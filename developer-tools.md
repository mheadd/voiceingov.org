I&#8217;m active in a number of developer communities, and have worked to share libraries in different languages for building open government applications and working with open gov APIs.

Here are some of the developer tools I have worked on:

### Open Government & 311 API tools:

  * [Open 311 PHP API Library](http://github.com/mheadd/PHPOpen311). A set of PHP classes for working with the [Open311 API](http://open311.org/).
  * [Open 311 C# API Library](http://github.com/mheadd/CSharpOpen311-v2). A set of C# classes for working with [Version 2 of the Open311 API](http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2) (GeoReport API V2)
  * [Open 311 Node.js Library](https://github.com/mheadd/node-open311). A Node.js module for working with [Version 2 of the Open311 API](http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2) (GeoReport API V2)

### Voice & Mobile Application Development Tools:

  * [Tropo WebAPI PHP](http://github.com/tropo/tropo-webapi-php). A set of PHP classes for working with the Voxeo [Tropo](https://www.tropo.com/home.jsp) WebAPI.
  * [Tropo WebAPI C#](http://github.com/tropo/tropo-webapi-csharp). A set of C# classes for working with the Voxeo [Tropo](https://www.tropo.com/home.jsp) WebAPI.

  * [PHPGrammar](http://github.com/mheadd/PHPGrammar). PHP classes that can be used to generate W3C XML Grammar files.
  * [Instant Messaging / SMS Bot Class](http://gist.github.com/226146). A small PHP class that makes it easy to interact with the IMified platform for building IM, SMS and Twitter apps. 
  * [SMSified PHP Library](https://github.com/smsified/smsified-php). A PHP library for interaction with the SMSified API.
  * [SMSified-Node](https://github.com/smsified/smsified-node). A Node.js module for interaction with the SMSified API.

More good stuff by me can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/mheadd).

If you&#8217;ve built a library for an open government data set, platform or API I&#8217;d love to [chat with you](mailto:mheadd@voiceingov.org) about it.
