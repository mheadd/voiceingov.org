In Delaware, the past week saw a State Auditor report released that showed <a href="http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20090311/NEWS/90311062" target="_blank">inappropriate use of state credit cards</a> by the former State CIO and several of his top staff members.

Now, in Washington, newly appointed federal CIO Vivek Kundra has <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=335877" target="_blank">taken a leave of absence</a> after FBI agents raided his former office (a week after he left) and arrested an office employee in a bribery scandal.

An altogether bad week for public sector CIOs. If the way that governments use technology is to be reformed, public sector CIOs will simply have to do better than this.

What a shame.
