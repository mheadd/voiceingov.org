The New York Times is [reporting on an Australian-based study](http://tech.nytimes.com/2005/07/12/technology/12auto.html) examining the link between cell phone usage and traffic accidents. It suggests that using a &#8220;hands free&#8221; phone does not aid in traffic safety, calling into question [laws allowing the use of hands free devices](http://www.ghsa.org/html/stateinfo/laws/cellphone_laws.html) in cars while driving.

> &#8220;There just doesn&#8217;t seem to be any safety benefit by restricting drivers to hands-free phones,&#8221; said Rae Tyson, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. &#8220;It&#8217;s the cognitive overload that sometimes occurs when you&#8217;re engaging in a conversation that is the source of the distraction more so than the manipulation of the device.&#8221;

The actual study appears in the [British Medical Journal](http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/) &#8211; should be an interesting read.
