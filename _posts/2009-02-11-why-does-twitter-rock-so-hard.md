Here&#8217;s why. From the <a href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2009/02/twitters-hackab.html" target="_blank">Wired Blog</a>:

> Using Twitter&#8217;s application programming interface (API), a programmer with even a modest amount of experience can create a web app that gathers public data from Twitter, or uses it to send links, commands or bursts of information.
> 
> &#8220;[Twitter&#8217;s] open API is a huge reason it has grown into such a platform&#8230; 

State and local governments strapped for cash (that&#8217;s all of them I think) take heed.

Open up your data &#8212; or, in the words of <a href="http://vivekkundra.blogspot.com/2008/12/building-digital-public-square.html" target="_blank">DC CTO Vivek Kundra</a>, &#8220;Democratize&#8221; your data &#8212; and let the development community build apps for you.
