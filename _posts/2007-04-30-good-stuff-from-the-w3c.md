The World Wide Web Consortium has been busy recently advancing standards that make up the Speech Interface Framework:

  * VoiceXML 2.1 is now a [Proposed Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/News/2007#item78). No surprise here, as most platforms have already adopted the changes in the 2.1 spec.
  * Semantic Interpretation is a W3C [Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/News/2007#item65). This is an important one that [I have written on before](http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=82). There is a clear need for some standardization among ASR vendors with respect to SI.

It would be nice to see some more movement on the [CCXML specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-ccxml-20070119/). Hopefully soon&#8230;
