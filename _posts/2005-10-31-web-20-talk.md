I made a presentation at the recent  [State of Delaware IT Conference](http://deitconference.state.de.us/DTC/DTCRegister.nsf/?open) on new advances in web application development. My talk focused specifically on Rich Interface Applications (RIAs â€“ i.e., AJAX), web services and [VoiceXML 2.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-voicexml21-20040323/).

My main theme in this talk was that despite a good deal of hype around some of these new technologies, they will ultimately have an impact on the way that applications are developed and maintained. Governments need to think about how these changes will affect them in the future, and also look for opportunities to exploit these new approaches to their benefit today.

A copy of my presentation can be [obtained here](http://deitconference.state.de.us/DTC/DTCRegister.nsf/f2f224ee493cecc685256e4e0058c1d9/5524eb81041dedad852570a00042baa8/$FILE/Web%20Application%20Development.ppt) (PPT format). Any feedback or reactions are welcome.
