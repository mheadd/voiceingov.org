VoiceXML 2.1 received &#8220;Candidate Recommendation&#8221; status from the W3C on [June 13th](http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/CR-voicexml21-20050613/), taking it [one step closer](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/Process-20040205/tr.html#maturity-levels) to the level of a formal standard.

There are a number of extremely cool features in the new specification that will make building dynamic voice applications with VoiceXML simpler and more efficient. A good overview of these new features can be found in the &#8220;First Words&#8221; column authored by Rob Marchand for the [VoiceXML Review](http://www.voicexmlreview.org/Sep2004/columns/sep2004_first_words.html).

Despite the relatively early stage in the process, most of the larger VoiceXML platform vendors now support most (if not all) the new functionality spelled out in the 2.1 specification.
