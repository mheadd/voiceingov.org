Voxeo has <a href="http://blogs.voxeo.com/voxeotalks/2008/08/19/voxeo-announces-prophecy-9-with-new-management-ui-new-sip-apis-and-linux-and-mac-os-x-support/" target="_blank">announced the release of the latest version of their Prophecy platform</a>.

Prophecy 9 includes a slew of new features, including (be still my heart) support for Linux. I&#8217;ve run VoiceXML platforms on Linux before, but I do not have fond memories of the install / maintenance process. The prospect of running a platform as easy to install and maintain as Prophecy on Linux is really exciting.

Head on over to the <a href="http://www.voxeo.com/prophecy/" target="_blank">Voxeo website</a> and check it out!
