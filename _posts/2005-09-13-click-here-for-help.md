It appears that the FEMA web site &#8212; where victims of Hurricane Katrina can submit requests for relief assistance &#8212; is [not compatible with certain browsers](http://www.webstandards.org/buzz/archive/2005_09.html#a000563), and may hinder some from filing requests.

This is an object lesson in the need to create accessible, standards-compliant web applications. Surely we can do better than this. Maybe FEMA Director Michael Brown can [focus on this](http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9315184/) when he retuirns to Washington.
