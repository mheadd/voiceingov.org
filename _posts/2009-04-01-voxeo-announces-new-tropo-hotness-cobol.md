Several weeks ago, Voxeo rocked the voice application development world by introducing <a href="http://www.tropo.com/" target="_blank">Tropo</a>, a new platform that allows developers to build voice applications in a <a href="http://docs.tropo.com/" target="_blank">variety of different languages</a>.

Tropo lets developers build voice applications in JavaScript, Ruby, Python, PHP and more. I mentioned Tropo briefly in [my last post](http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=759), where I describe a voice application I built using VoiceXML/PHP &#8212; I&#8217;ll be porting this app to Tropo shortly so that it will be close to 100% PHP and running on the Tropo platform.

Voxeo announced today that they are adding support for yet another development language to Tropo &#8212; **COBOL**. This is big &#8211; it brings the total number of languages supported to a half dozen. I can&#8217;t wait to see what Voxeo has in store for Tropo next!

Let me tell you something &#8211; you go into a bar and drop some hints that you are coding your Tropo app in COBOL and you will not be leaving alone.

I guarantee it!
