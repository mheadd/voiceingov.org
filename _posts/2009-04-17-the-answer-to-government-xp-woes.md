<a href="http://www.govtech.com/gt/articles/640438" target="_blank">Government Technology Magazine</a> is reporting on the reaction of state and local government IT officials to the recent decision of Microsoft to <a href="http://www.govtech.com/gt/articles/640438" target="_blank">discontinue support</a> for Windows XP and Office 2003:

> Microsoft dropped free support this week for Windows XP and Office 2003, leaving state and local governments wondering when they&#8217;ll be forced to move computers to a newer operating system.
> 
> Lisa Moorehead, the director of management information systems in the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, said her department doesn&#8217;t have the budget to pay for repeated incident-report calls.

> &#8220;That is going to pose huge problems to us and force us to potentially go to an operating system we don&#8217;t want to go to,&#8221; said Moorhead, who isn&#8217;t thrilled with one of her other options: the newer Windows Vista operating system.
