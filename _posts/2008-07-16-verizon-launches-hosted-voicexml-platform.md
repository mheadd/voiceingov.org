A friend just sent <a href="http://www.speechtechmag.com/Articles/News/News-Feature/Verizon-Launches-Hosted-Speech-Platform-49901.aspx" target="_blank">this</a> to me:

> Verizon Business today launched Open Hosted Speech Services (OHSS), a speech platform that allows customers to create and host their own speech applications&#8230;[the platform includes] a hosted IVR application, a VoiceXML interpreter, text-to-speech capabilities, and a speaker verification application.

Hey, Verizon&#8230; 2001 called for you. Its wants its idea back.

Companies like [Voxeo](http://www.voxeo.com/), [BeVocal](http://bevocal.com/corporateweb/) (now owned by Nuance) and [TellMe](https://studio.tellme.com/) (now owned by Microsoft) have been doing this for a long time.
