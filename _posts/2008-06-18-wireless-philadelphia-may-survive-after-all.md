It looks like a [group of local investors](http://www.philly.com/dailynews/local/20080617_Wireless_Philadelphia_may_survive_after_all.html) may pick up where EarthLink left off.

This is good news, but more work is still needed to complete the network:

> &#8220;We&#8217;re not anywhere near close to delivering a full service yet,&#8221; said local entrepreneur Richard A. Rasansky, who is on the board of the new company [that will take over the network]. &#8220;The network is not completed. It&#8217;s not so much a problem with how it&#8217;s built, it&#8217;s that it&#8217;s currently unbuilt.&#8221;
