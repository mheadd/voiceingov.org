The W3C has released the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-voicexml30-20081219/" target="_blank">First Public Working Draft of Voice Extensible Markup Language (VoiceXML) 3.0</a>. This is the next version of the VoiceXML language that reportedly will include a host of new features, including speaker authentication.

Although this is an early draft, according to the document:

> By the middle of 2009 the group expects to have all existing functionality defined in detail, the new functionality stubbed out, and the VoiceXML 2.1 profile largely defined. By late-2009 the group expects to have all functionality defined and both profiles defined in detail. 

I&#8217;ve got to find some time to go through this document &#8212; in addition to being a very interesting read, it might be kind of neat to provide input that might get incorporated into the standard by the W3C.

Guess I know what I&#8217;ll be doing for New Year&#8217;s Eve. ðŸ˜‰
