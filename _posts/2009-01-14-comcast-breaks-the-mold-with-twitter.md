I just had a surreal customer service experience this morning that I feel I need to share.

Less than 2 hours ago, I tried opening a new browser tab and got an error. I noticed that my Internet connection was down by glancing at the cable modem connected to my wireless router.

I needed to take break anyway, so before heading out for a fresh cup of coffee I decided to send out a quick Tweet using my cell phone. Naturally I used my 140 characters to rail against the faceless monopoly that had left me stranded without a connection to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f99PcP0aFNE" target="_blank">the &#8220;Tubes&#8221;</a> &#8212; its always easy to be dramatic and take cheap shots when no one is listening.

Except someone is listening&#8230;

Within an hour of my Tweet bashing Comcast, I had not one but **two** responses from Comcast Customer Support people on Twitter &#8212; both asked very nicely how they could help. This takes customer service to an entirely new level!

I&#8217;m absolutely blown that Comcast is monitoring Twitter and pro-actively responding to customer complaints in this way. More companies should do this. (Hell, more <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=DMV" target="_blank">governments should do this</a>.)

From now on, if I have any problems with my Internet connection, my first order of business will be to use Twitter. Help from Comcast is only a Tweet away.
