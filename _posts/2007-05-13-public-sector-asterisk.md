Recently came across some information from a small city in Mississippi that is using Asterisk/Trixbox for it&#8217;s <a href="http://web.vicksburg.org/vicksburg/Departments/IT/PhoneSystem/tabid/260/Default.aspx" target="_blank">internal phone system</a>.

<a href="http://www.vicksburg.org/" target="_blank">Vicksburg</a> is a city of about 26,000 in Western Mississippi that looks to have a roughly 200 extension Asterisk system in place for city employees.

It&#8217;s nice to see governments making use of open source technologies, particularly Asterisk &#8212; it **isn&#8217;t** just for small businesses. I wonder how many other small to medium sized governments are using a flavor of Asterisk for their phone systems?
