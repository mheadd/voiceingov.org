This month promises to be an important one for the advancement of open standards for voice applications.

The World Wide Web Consortium is <a href="http://www.w3.org/Voice/#plan" target="_blank">scheduled to publish</a> the CCXML 1.0 standard as a &#8220;Candidate Recommendation&#8221; this month, an important step in the advancement of this standard and the first change in its status in some time (the standard has been stalled in &#8220;Last Call Working Draft&#8221; status since January of 1997).

I and other voice application developers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of this milestone. The time has come to move this important standard forward.
