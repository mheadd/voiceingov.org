The landscape of cloud telephony continues to change.

I was heartened this week to see some of the sharpest minds I know in cloud telephony and unified communications get together with the acquisition of [Teleku](http://teleku.com) by [Voxeo](http://www.voxeo.com). Teleku and Voxeo&#8217;s [Tropo](http://tropo.com) service are complimentary ones that offer lots of goodies for developers, and I&#8217;m anxious to see what these guys will be cooking up now that they have joined forces. Congrats to all involved!

While there is lots of discussion about [what this acquisition means for the constantly changing landscape of cloud telephony](http://gigaom.com/2010/08/11/voxeo-tropo-teleku/), this move validates (in my mind) some of the important trends that will determine which cloud telephony companies will be around for the long-term and how developers will use their services.

None of this is new &#8211; [I&#8217;ve said it all before](http://blog.cloudvox.com/post/443681724/mark-headd-on-open311-sip-portability-and-more). It is worth noting, however, that all of the trends that I&#8217;ve observed before that are going to make the difference in the cloud telephony space are ones that both Tropo and Teleku do very well.

**Portability** &#8211; underscored not only by Teleku&#8217;s support for the open standard VoiceXML, but also the Tropo crew&#8217;s involvement in the Asterisk world, and the defacto standard for building Asterisk apps in Ruby &#8211; [Adhearsion](http://adhearsion.com/).

**SIP integration** &#8211; remember this kids: true cloud telephony has [SIP](http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/SIP) baked in &#8211; the rest is just marketing fluff. Both Tropo and Teleku support SIP interoperability and make it very easy for developers to use SIP as part of their applications.

**Multi-channel / multi-modality** &#8211; Both Tropo and Teleku have big multi-modal chops. Being able to interact with users on multiple communication channels from one code base is a key tenet of unified communications and cloud telephony, and this will become increasingly important in the future.

**Speech recognition** &#8211; cloud telephony isn&#8217;t your grandfather&#8217;s way to build a phone app, so why should users be restricted to their grandfather&#8217;s way of interacting with a phone app? Speech recognition is fully supported in both Tropo and Teleku, and this will matter more and more to cloud telephony developers going forward.

So if you&#8217;re wondering what the next change in the cloud telephony landscape will be, you can bet that one of these trends will dictate the change.

Until then, I&#8217;ll be hacking on some cloud-based, speech rec enabled UC apps. ðŸ˜‰
