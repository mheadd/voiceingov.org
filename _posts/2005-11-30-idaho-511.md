It looks like the [State of Idaho](http://511.idaho.gov) is the [latest state](http://www.govtech.net/news/news.php?id=97410) to implement a 511 traveler information service. Not a lot of information available on the technology used, but the system appears to accept both voice and <acronym title="Dual Tone Multi Frequency">DTMF</acronym> input. It also appears that Idaho is partnering with other states in reserving phone lines for the system, to help spread the cost.

Idaho is the [24th state](http://www.deploy511.org/deploystatus.htm) to implement a 511 system.
