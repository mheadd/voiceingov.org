One of the few browserâ€™s to support the developing [XHTML+Voice](http://my.opera.com/community/dev/voice/) standard is now free.

This is a great step forward for the advancement of the [X+V standard](http://www.voicexml.org/specs/multimodal/x+v/12/), and a signal to governments everywhere that it is now time to incorporate this new standard into their web pages and applications to improve accessibility.

Download the [Opera Browser](http://my.opera.com/mheadd/affiliate/) now and [get up to snuff](http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?page_id=53) on how to create X+V content. Your customers (i.e., the taxpayers) will thank you for it.
