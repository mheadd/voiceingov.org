As scary as it seems, I will soon be published in the [Encyclopedia of Digital Government](http://www.idea-group.com/reference/details.asp?ID=5066). I submitted an article arguing in favor of the use or voice technologies &#8212; specifically VoiceXML and it&#8217;s sister technologies &#8212; to improve government service delivery.

> The Encyclopedia of Digital Government offers the most comprehensive coverage of the issues, concepts, trends, and technologies of digital government (or electronic government). The challenges and future prospects faced by governments at different institutional levels and in different parts of the world are described in explicit detail in this commanding encyclopedia.

Do check it out if you can, or [recommend](http://www.idea-group.com/recommend.asp?ID=5066) this two volume set to a library near you.
