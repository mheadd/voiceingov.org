The Township of Edison, New Jersey recently provided [a poignant example](http://ems.gmnews.com/news/2005/0727/Front_page/009.html) in how not to practice voting by telephone.

It seems an Edison Township Council member was away at a boy scout camp when an ordinance authorizing the lease of almost 30 police cars came before the Council for a vote. The Council member in question [attempted to participate](http://ems.gmnews.com/news/2005/0727/Front_page/009.html) in the vote via speaker phone. After other Council members expressed frustration over the poor sound quality (and also questioned the legality of participating in a vote of Council by remote means), the action was tabled for a future meeting.

There is some hidden irony in this incident &#8212; audio quality is just one of many factors that can negatively impact perceptions of voice applications, or phone-based services. Edison, New Jersey takes its name from the famous inventor Thomas Alva Edison, who resided in Menlo Park during the late 1800&#8217;s. During his time there, Edison invented the first device to record spoken audio &#8212; the phonograph. Edison was also instrumental in making [critical improvements to the telephone](http://www.ieee-virtual-museum.org/collection/tech.php?id=2345870&lid=1) to improve sound quality.

Seems Edison, New Jersey should aspire to be more like its famous namesake and focus on better sound quality. I&#8217;ll volunteer my services should they decide to ever deploy a VoiceXML application. ðŸ˜‰
