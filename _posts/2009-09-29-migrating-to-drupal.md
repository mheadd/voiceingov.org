Over the next week or two, I&#8217;ll be moving [this blog](http://www.voiceingov.org) to a new host and migrating to <a href="http://drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a>.

My experience with Drupal is limited to some work I did for a friend (and the current <a href="http://ltgov.delaware.gov/" target="_blank">Lt. Governor of Delaware</a>) some months ago, and also [some tinkering](http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=544) on my own time. I&#8217;d like to be more proficient in Drupal and start developing my own custom modules, so I&#8217;ll be jumping in with both feet and porting this site over in the near future.

I still love <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> (it rocks!) but I feel like its time to move on up the CMS food chain a bit. Stay tuned for tips and lessons learned from the migration.
