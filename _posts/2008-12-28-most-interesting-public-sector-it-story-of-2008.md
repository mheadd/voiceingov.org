Hands down this goes to <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/archives/t.jsp?N=s&V=107545" target="_blank">the curious case of Terry Childs</a>; the City of San Francisco Network Administrator who allegedly &#8220;went rouge&#8221; and locked city officials out of the citywide network.

Childs, who seems to have become <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/5048957/why-san-francisco-deserved-to-lose-control-of-its-network" target="_blank">something of a cult hero</a> among IT professionals, was arrested earlier this year for his actions and <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-10129313-83.html?tag=newsEditorsPicksArea.0" target="_blank">now faces trial</a> for them.

I suspect that we&#8217;ll soon see &#8220;Free Terry Childs&#8221; shirts popping up.
