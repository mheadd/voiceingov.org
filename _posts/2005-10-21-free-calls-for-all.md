Meg Whitman, Chair and CEO of eBay, made [an interesting prediction](http://news.com.com/eBay+chief+foresees+free+voice+calls+for+all/2100-7352_3-5904540.html) about the futrure of Internet telephony recently. In an interview with financial analysts discussing eBay&#8217;s purchase of Skype, Whitman said:

> &#8220;In the end, the price that anyone can provide for voice transmission on the &#8216;Net will trend toward zero&#8230;&#8221;

This raises questions about what is next for the world of telephony and voice applications. There is an [interesting post](http://iotum.com/simplyrelevant/2005/10/21/voice-20-a-manifesto-for-the-future/) on the Simply Relevant blog describing the concept of "Voice 2.0." The concept and term (which appears to be derived from the notion of [Web 2.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0)) are, in the words of the author:

> ""¦the marriage of IP Telephony to the Web."

There is a good discussion in this post about the confluence of certain factors that will drive the development of Voice 2.0 "“ things like meterless calling (via Skype or a similar service), development tools for building web applications like [PHPVoice](http://vxml.sourceforge.net/) (a project to which I am a contributor) and [presence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presence_Information).

While I agree with the author, I'd add another recent technology to the mix "“ [podcasting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting). One of the key differences between the visual web and the voice web (or Voice 2.0 if you want to think of it that way) is permanence. A voice conversation or interaction happens in real time while the visual web has more permanence "“ value can be "stored up" as text or images and reread, reviewed and referenced for an indefinite period of time.

Podcasting is a recent trend that seeks to do something similar with voice "“ to store the value of a conversation in the form of an MP3 file that can be referenced at a later time. Its still pretty new, but so is this whole concept of Voice 2.0 (or Web 2.0 for that matter).
