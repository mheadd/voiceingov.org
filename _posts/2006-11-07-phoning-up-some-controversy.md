It&#8217;s interesting to see the part that automated outbound calling applications (or &#8220;robo calls&#8221; as they are more commonly referred to) are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/07/us/politics/07robo.html?_r=1&ref=politics&oref=slogin" target="_blank">playing in the election</a> taking place today.

Unfortunately, it looks like for the most part they are not being used very scrupulously:

> Political messages are exempt from the federal do-not-call rules meant to discourage unwanted sales pitches. But a New Hampshire law prohibits making automated calls to people who are on the do-not-call list. The Republican committee agreed on Sunday to halt calls there at the urging of the state attorney general. 

I haven&#8217;t gotten that many calls, but for the next election I&#8217;ll be getting my <a href="http://nerdvittles.com/index.php?p=75" target="_blank">Asterisk set up</a> configured to block this kind of nonsense.
