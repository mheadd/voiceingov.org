<a href="http://www.211maine.org/" target="_blank">Maine</a> has joined 15 other states in rolling out a 2-1-1 service. <a href="http://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/index.php?topic=Portal+News&id=22123&v=article-2006" target="_blank">Governor John Baldacci</a> was on hand last week to place the inaugural call.

Interestingly, there doesn&#8217;t appear to be any automation with the Maine 2-1-1 service. All calls (24/7) go to a representative.

Where is the fun in that&#8230;? ðŸ˜‰
