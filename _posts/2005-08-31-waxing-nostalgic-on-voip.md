There is an old maxim in the fashion business that says that everything comes back into style eventually. (I&#8217;ll prove it &#8212; I never thought Iâ€™d be wearing wide-bottom jeans again, but here we are.)

This same principle can be applied to technology. Who would have thought that [mainframes would make a comeback](http://uk.builder.com/0,39026540,39214317,00.htm)? Who would have thought that the richness of more traditional desktop client-server applications (as opposed to the relatively sparser GUIâ€™s of web-based applications) would [come back into vogue](http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php)?

And so it is with voice technologies. When I read about the latest Voice over IM development (for example, [this one](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1817029,00.asp), and [this one here](http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/3531216), and of course [this one](http://news.zdnet.co.uk/communications/0,39020336,39214652,00.htm)), I canâ€™t help but think about the early days of VoIP. Remember when the only way to use VoIP was on your PC â€“ before [Vonage](http://www.vonage.com/) or the other providers brought VoIP to your telephone? I came across this neat article on the [history of VoIP](http://www.voipreview.org/news.details.aspx?nid=51) as I was reminiscing that provides a good description of the early days.

So it looks like VoIP has advanced to the point where its making a comback on the PC&#8230;? Weird.
