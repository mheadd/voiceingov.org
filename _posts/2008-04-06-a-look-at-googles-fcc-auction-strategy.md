The NY Times has a [really interesting article](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/04/technology/04auction.html?_r=1&ref=technology&oref=slogin) detailing the strategy of Google executives bidding on wireless spectrum in the recent FCC auction.

Google&#8217;s legacy from this historic auction is that it helped ensure that a portion of the spectrum purchased would be [subject to specific requirements of openness](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/07/23/2020216&from=rss). The &#8220;C Block&#8221; of spectrum that the FCC will require be managed under the tenants of openness was ultimately [won by Verizon Wireless](http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,143675-pg,1/article.html).

Even though Google didn&#8217;t &#8220;win&#8221; the auction for the C Block outright, there are those that believe that their strategy of opening up the world of wireless communication may have been served nonetheless:

> â€œIf Google had won a license, there was only downside risk for them,â€ said Gregory L. Rosston, a former F.C.C. official and senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. â€œNow they can just spend $1 million a year on a law firm to ensure Verizon lives up to the openness requirements.â€
