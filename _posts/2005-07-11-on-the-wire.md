Google's [decision to invest](http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3518341) in a company focusing on delivering broadband Internet access over power lines (often referred to as "BPL" "“ Broadband over Power Line, or &#8220;PLC&#8221; "“ Power Line Communications) was the first in what appears to be a one-two punch for BPL this week. It's now being reported that IBM is [also making an investment](http://news.com.com/IBM+partners+to+offer+broadband+from+a+wall+plug/2100-1034_3-5782194.html?tag=nefd.top) in BPL via a company called CenterPoint Energy in Houston, TX.

The advent of [widespread BPL access](http://www.upaplc.org/) creates an interesting possibility of a new way of providing <acronym title="Voice over Internet Protocol">VoIP</acronym> telephone service. It also suggests the possibility of new players in the VoIP space (i.e., power companies). This is interesting for many reasons "“ states and local government have a [revenue and regulatory stake](http://www.ncsl.org/programs/energy/EleIndReg.htm) in the power industry, and the field of VoIP providers is getting uncomfortably crowded given that there [isn't a clear regulatory picture](http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,118193,00.asp) as yet.

This is another good indicator that states and local governments need to constantly evaluate their revenue and regulatory environments in light of new advances in technology. Governments that don't take these proactive steps [risk being left out](http://governing.com/articles/4voip.htm) in the cold as new ways of delivering old services emerge.
