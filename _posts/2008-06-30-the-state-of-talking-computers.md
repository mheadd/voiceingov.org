The New Yorker has [an interesting piece](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/06/23/080623fa_fact_seabrook) about the state of speech synthesis and voice recognition. Decades after the original notion of the &#8220;conversational computer&#8221; was first conceptualized, where are we?

Turns out, we&#8217;re not as far along as we thought we&#8217;d be. Scientists and researchers found out the hard way that modeling speech is waaaaaay harder than anyone thought it would be. Don&#8217;t go throwing that keyboard away just yet.

A fascinating read &#8212; we&#8217;ve come so far, and yet we are still so far away from the original vision of the talking computer.
