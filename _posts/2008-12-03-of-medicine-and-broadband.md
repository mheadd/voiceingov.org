With services like <a href="http://www.bewell.com/" target="_blank">bewell.com</a> and <a href="http://www.americanwell.com/index.html" target="_blank">americanwell.com</a> popping up, it looks as if our interactions with doctors and medical professionals will increasingly take place on the Internet.

Whether its through the Facebook-like groups of BeWell (referred to as &#8220;expert-guided communities&#8221;), or through a web camera (i.e., the &#8220;virtual house call&#8221; pitched by American Well), the quality of a person&#8217;s Internet connection may one day soon have a meaningful impact on the quality of medical information that person receives.

These new interactive medical services follow the unveiling of other web-based health services from both <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en-US/health/about/index.html" target="_blank">Google</a> and Microsoft.

As health care services become increasingly web-based, the problem of the digital divide generally, and the <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/220/report_display.asp" target="_blank">broadband divide</a> specifically, will become more acute.

This is an area where we could use some original thinking, and some fresh ideas. Public policy leaders need to step up on this one &#8211; it ain&#8217;t going to fix itself.
