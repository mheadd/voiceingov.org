A very interesting new extension for the Firefox web browser became available recently on alphaWorks (IBM&#8217;s site devoted to emerging technologies). The [&#8220;Tadpole&#8221; extension](http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/tadpole) implements the [X+V specification](http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?page_id=13) for the Firefox web browser.

Those already familiar with X+V know that the Opera browser has, for some time, [supported this language](http://dev.opera.com/articles/voice/) for building multimodal applications. However, a Firefox extension for X+V raises some additional possibilities &#8212; a mashup between X+V and [XUL](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xul/ "XML User Interface Language") anyone?

While I lack the courage to build the necessary [software prerequisites](http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/tadpole/requirements) to run this extension (like the Opera browser&#8217;s support for X+V, the Tadpole extension will only work on Windows) reading about it did inspire me to upgrade to the latest version of the Opera browser &#8212; 9.24 &#8212; and play around with some X+V samples.

It got me thinking about the X+V standard and where it&#8217;s heading. It&#8217;s very likely that the W3C&#8217;s work on the new VoiceXML 3.0 standard will incorporate changes meant to support multimodal applications. A sneak preview of the new standard can be viewed [on the W3C site](http://www.w3.org/Voice/2006/voicexml3.pdf).

To say that I&#8217;m excited for the first public draft of the VoiceXML 3.0 standard next Spring would be a monumental understatement!
