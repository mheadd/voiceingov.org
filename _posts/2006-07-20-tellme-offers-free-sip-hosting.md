TellMe is now offering an [interesting new hosting option for VoiceXML applications](https://studio.tellme.com/freesip/reachingaudience.html). Developers that use the TellMe studio can sign up for a limited access hosting account that will allow up to four simultaneous calls to reach their application. All calls must utilize SIP to reach the VoiceXML application.

I have yet to dig into the details, but this sounds very interesting. I&#8217;ve used the TellMe studio in the past, and it has some great features. In fact, the first VoiceXML applications deployed by [State of Delaware](http://dti.delaware.gov/services/accessde.shtml) when I worked there used the TellMe platform (not sure if they still do).

For those that have not tried the TellMe studio, this might be a great incentive to give it a whirl. As IP telephony becomes more ubiquitous, it will be interesting to see how the major VoiceXML platforms shake up their service offerings.
