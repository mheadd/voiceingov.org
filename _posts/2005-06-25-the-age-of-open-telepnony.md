Are we entering a new age of telephony, one where the old rules don&#8217;t apply and new opportunities exist? Several developing trends suggest that the telephone industry (typically very slow to change) is headed for a big shake up. What is the catalyst for this change? Technology, of course.

Who can deny the impact that the development of open standards for phone-based applications &#8211; VoiceXML, CCXML, SRGS, etc. &#8211; has had on the vendor community. Are there even any vendors left that don&#8217;t support VoiceXML? [One article](http://www.voicexmlreview.org/Apr2005/features/softswitch.html) discussing how these standards are creating new opportunities appears in the recent issue of VoiceXML Review. Its focus is a discussion of the feasibility of using CCXML to create a software [PBX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBX).

Other trends are also driving change, like the emergence of Voice over Internet Protocol ([VoIP](http://www.fcc.gov/voip/)) and the maturity of new open source software products like [Asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org/). A nice article discussing [the impact that Asterisk is having](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/06/23/pbx.html) on the telephone industry can be found on the O&#8217;Reilly OnLAMP site. There is also an [interview with Mark Spencer](http://news.com.com/Is+the+telephone+industry+ready+for+open+source/2008-1082_3-5737703.html) of Digium (the company that makes Asterisk) available from CNET News. To put this trend into perspective, using open source tools like Asterisk:

> With a Linux server, off-the-shelf LAN/WAN hardware, a broadband connection, and SIP-compatible telephone handsets, one can now build a fully functional telephone system, complete with high-end features.

Will the telephone industry ever be the same again? Probably not â€“ and that is hugely important for governments as major users of telephone services. It&#8217;s also critical given government&#8217;s [regulatory oversight and tax administration](http://governing.com/articles/4voip.htm) role over the telephone industry.
