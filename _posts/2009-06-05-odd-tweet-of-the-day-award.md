Although it seems a bit early to be handing out an award that could cover the entire day (and it&#8217;s only 9:30 AM EST), the **Odd Tweet of the Day Award** goes to:

I have know idea what this Tweet means, and suspect it was posted in error &#8211; perhaps someone at FEMA though they were typing into their IM client.
