It&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve been saying &#8212; its all about the phone. Or, rather, it&#8217;s [all about the cell phone](http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/179/report_display.asp).

The [latest report](http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Cell_phone_study.pdf) from the Pew Internet and American Life Project should reinforce for governments what they must (if they read anything I write) already know. Telephones generally are the most ubiquitous, widely used, most evenly distributed communications device in the US. As it relates to cell phones specifically:

> 74% of the Americans who own mobile phones say they have used their hand-held device in an emergency and gained valuable help.

Governments that are smart about implementing Amber Alert systems, or reverse 911 systems are taking note (I hope). This report also dovetails with other research, including that of the Pew Internet and American Life Project, which shows that [most Americans contact their government using their telephone](http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/128/report_display.asp).
