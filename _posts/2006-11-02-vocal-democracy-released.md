The alpha version of [Vocal Democracy](http://vdemocracy.sourceforge.net/) is now available for download from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=138695). I've already got lots of changes planned, but I'm excited to get feedback on the state of the work so far.

This version was designed specifically to run on the <a href="http://www.voxeo.com/prophecy/" target="_blank">Voxeo Prophecy</a> platform. Going forward, I'll be working on enhancements that will help ensure this package runs easily on a wide array of VoiceXML platforms.
