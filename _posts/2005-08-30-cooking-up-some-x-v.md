I&#8217;ve got a [new tutorial](http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?page_id=53) up explaining how to turn XHTML into X+V using a nice little PHP class library called [MiniXML](http://minixml.psychogenic.com/). This approach is still a bit rough, and I&#8217;m continuing to refine it but it seems to work fairly well for small to moderately sized XHTML documents.

Ultimately, I think this could become a very powerful and flexible way to turn plain old visual XHTML into multimodal X+V with nothing more than Apache/PHP and some clever coding. [Have a look](http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?page_id=53) and let me know what you think.
