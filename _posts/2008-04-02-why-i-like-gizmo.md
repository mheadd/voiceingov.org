Oprah [loves Skype](http://www.mediaincanada.com/articles/mic/20080305/oprah.html), but I&#8217;m pretty fond of [Gizmo](http://gizmo5.com/pc/products/desktop/).

If your like me then you&#8217;ve probably got a number of different VoIP and IM clients running on your computer(s) &#8212; Skype, Google Talk, Gizmo, etc. I&#8217;ve used Skype heavily in the past, but I&#8217;ve now moved on to Gizmo. Here&#8217;s why:

  * **I want something that will run on Linux**. No, I don&#8217;t use Windows unless I have to, so this pretty much takes Google Talk out of the picture.
  * **I want something that will let me IM contacts in multiple networks**. Google Talk can do this, as can Gizmo &#8212; Skype can&#8217;t.
  * **I want something that will hook into my Asterisk server easily**. Google Talk [can do this](http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Asterisk+Speaks+with+Google+Talk), but it&#8217;s a [piece of cake with Gizmo](http://gizmo5.com/pc/network/asterix-support/) because it uses [SIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol).

In addition, Gizmo works great with services like [GrandCentral](http://www.grandcentral.com/howitworks/gizmo). To be fair, Google Talk has everything I want &#8212; if it only ran on Linux I&#8217;d be on it like stink on a monkey. Perhaps in time.

Skype may be more popular, and Goggle Talk may have more buzz but Gizmo is the VoIP / IM client for me. For now&#8230;
