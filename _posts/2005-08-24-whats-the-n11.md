Seems like more people are familiar with the concept of abbreviated dialing designations because of [Mary J. Blige](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000002OME/104-1244522-1205504?v=glance) than anything the FCC has put out. Still, the FCC has put together a [very nice summary](http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Common_Carrier/News_Releases/2000/nrc0036a.html) explaining Abbreviated Dialing Codes (sometimes referred to as N11) that is worth a read from those working in the public sector.

More and more state governments are starting to implement systems based on N11 designations &#8211; the State of Utah has a VoiceXML-based 511 system, as does the [State of Virginia](http://www.virginiadot.org/infoservice/news/CO02152002-511.asp) (I believe both are using the TellMe platform). The [State of Oklahoma](http://www.govtech.net/news/news.php?id=96339) is now doing some interesting things with 211.

Rollout of systems based on these designations is still somewhat uneven &#8212; organizations advocating for the adoption of [511](http://www.deploy511.org/deploystatus.htm) and [211](http://www.211.org/status.html) systems track implementations closely. Let&#8217;s hope that as more and more states deploy systems, they will build them using open standards. Mary&#8217;s got no love for vendor lock in.
