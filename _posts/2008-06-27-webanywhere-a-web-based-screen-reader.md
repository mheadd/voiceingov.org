Just happened upon a story [from the University of Washington News](http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleID=42563) describing a project to build a web-based screen reader &#8212; called [WebAnywhere](http://webanywhere.cs.washington.edu/) &#8212; to allow the visually impaired to surf the web.

Most people have heard of or even tried [screen readers like Jaws](http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs_products/software_jaws.asp). The problem with software like Jaws is that it must be installed and run on the computer a visual impaired person is using. This can be inconvenient if someone is traveling, or is otherwise away from home or work.

WebAnywhere is different in that it is web-based, so there is no software to install. Any computer can be made more accessible to the visually impaired as long as it has a browser. The software that runs WebAnywhere is available for review from [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/webanywhere/).

This sounds like an outstanding project &#8212; I&#8217;ll have to pull the source code down and take a look at it.
