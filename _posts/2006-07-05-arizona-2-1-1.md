A while back, I wrote an entry about [Abbreviated Dialing Codes](http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=51) used by governments (sometimes referred to as N11).

The State of Arizona has [announced the results](http://www.govtech.net/news/news.php?id=100058) of the first year of activity for its 2-1-1 service, which includes both an online component and a call center. 

> Arizona&#8217;s Strategic Plan for 2-1-1 calls for the phased implementation of 2-1-1. The next step for the program is development of local 2-1-1 call centers serving all Arizonans day-to-day as well as in times of emergency.
