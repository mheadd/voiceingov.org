A few weeks ago, I wrote about the [need for standards to guide governments](http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=405) in their use of microblogging platforms like <a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.

Government Technology magazine has a <a href="http://www.govtech.com/gt/579338" target="_blank">new article</a> about the different uses being found for Twitter in the public sector, highlighting some popular applications &#8212; including the use of Twitter for emergency notifications (something I&#8217;ve [written about before](http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=154)). They even provide <a href="http://www.govtech.com/gt/articles/583303" target="_blank">a Twitter &#8220;primer&#8221;</a> for CIOs.

As the use of microblogging platforms by the public sector increase, I think the need for some basic standards will grow more acute.

It would be nice to see an organization like NASCIO or a similar organization step in and provide some guidance to governments that would help make public-sector Twitter accounts easier to find and more consistent.

**UPDATE:**

A friend just made me wise to <a href="http://www.fema.gov/media/2009/010909.shtm" target="_blank">an interesting event</a> taking place in just a few minutes:

> FEMA Administrator David Paulison will be available from 3 -3:30 pm Monday, Jan 12, 2009, to give a message and reply to questions using the agencyâ€™s Twitter account, <a href="http://twitter.com/femainfocus" target="_blank">femainfocus</a>. The agencyâ€™s top official will discuss where FEMA was, where it is now, and where he sees it going. 

This looks like a pretty novel way of using Twitter to communicate with the public, and I&#8217;m interested to see how it goes.
