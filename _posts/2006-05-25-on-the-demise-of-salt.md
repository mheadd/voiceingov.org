There has been much talk of late on Microsoft&#8217;s announcement that it will [support VoiceXML](http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;868712853;fp;2;fpid;1) in a forthcoming version of Speech Server. Many that I have read or listened to have pointed to this as 

  * Good news; and,

[Speech Application Language Tags](http://www.saltforum.org/faq/faq.asp) were designed to be extensions to XHTML "“ in other words, the specification was developed specifically to build multimodal applications. And although you can build pure telephone applications with SALT, this was not the original intent.

So, if Microsoft suddenly got religion and decided to support VoiceXML for building telephone applications it may mean that multimodal applications aren&#8217;t going anywhere for a while. That&#8217;s bad news in my opinion.

I&#8217;d ask that readers refute this assertion by pointing out some existing production uses of multimodal technology. If they can find any&#8230;
