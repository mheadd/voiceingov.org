It&#8217;s nice to see that the State of Delaware is <a href="http://www.gcn.com/print/25_32/42505-1.html" target="_blank">still receiving acclaim</a> for the Access Delaware project that I helped start several years ago with <a href="http://www.state.de.us/ltgov/default.shtml" target="_blank">Lt. Governor John Carney</a>. After it&#8217;s initial launch, the project was selected as an award winner in the Accenture/MIT Digital Government Award program &#8212; one of the first national technology awards the State of Delaware ever received.

Thanks to a core group of dedicated programmers in the Department of Technology and Information, and the support of forward-thinking public officials like John Carney, the project continues to evolve and improve.

It&#8217;s interesting to go back now and [listen to an interview](http://www.voiceingov.org/media/wdel_com_interview.htm) I gave when the program was first launched. I&#8217;m amazed, and very proud that the program is still being recognized. Now, if only more governments would follow this lead&#8230; ðŸ˜‰
