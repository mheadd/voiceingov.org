**Vacancy Description:**

There is an immediate opening in my life for a smart, fast, next-generation IM client that can integrate with multiple social networks, standard XMPP servers, email and POP accounts and VoIP services.

**Candidates already evaluated:**

**<a href="http://www.digsby.com/" target="_blank">Digsby</a>**: Digsby is an IM client that connects to AIM, MSN, Yahoo, ICQ, Google Talk, Jabber, and Facebook Chat.

> _Pros:_
> 
>   * Can be used to manage e-mail on different networks (Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo Mail, AOL/AIM Mail, IMAP, and POP accounts).
>   * Integrates with social networks like Facebook (receive friend requests, etc.) and Twitter (change status).
> 
> _Cons:_ 
> 
>   * Windows only (for now).
>   * Can&#8217;t use for VoIP phone / video calls.

**<a href="http://www.wengophone.com/index.php" target="_blank">WengoPhone</a>**: A SIP client that also integrates with IM networks such as Google and AIM.

> _Pros:_
> 
>   * Multi-platform (runs on Windows, Linux or Mac).
>   * Supports SIP.
>   * Support for AIM and Jabber IM accounts.
> 
> _Cons:_ 
> 
>   * Can&#8217;t integrate with social networks like Facebook.
>   * Can&#8217;t be used to manage e-mail accounts

**<a href="http://www.meebo.com/" target="_blank">Meebo</a>**: A web-based service that integrates with a host of different IM and social networks, including Facebook and MySpace.

> _Pros:_
> 
>   * Web-based &#8212; no install required, and can be accessed from anywhere.
>   * Can connect to AIM, Yahoo, Google, MySpace, Facebook, Jabber and ICQ accounts
> 
> _Cons:_
> 
>   * Can&#8217;t use for VoIP phone / video calls.
>   * Ad supported, so I get asked if I want to watch Miley Cyrus videos on occasion (who doesn&#8217;t though&#8230;)

This position will remain open until a suitable candidate has been found.
