The District of Columbia is sponsoring an innovative contest to encourage developers to build applications that utilize data published on everything from <a href="http://data.octo.dc.gov/" target="_blank">crime locations to building permits</a>.

The development contest &#8212; <a href="http://www.appsfordemocracy.org/" target="_blank">Apps for Democracy</a> &#8212; is currently underway, and concludes on November 12th.

I&#8217;ve signed up for this contest and will be submitting an application for consideration &#8212; I&#8217;ll be building a multimodal application using <a href="http://www.voxeo.com/prophecy/" target="_blank">Voxeo Prophecy</a> and the [HAWHAW PHP library](http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?page_id=41). I hope to have it done by the end of the week and will post details here, and probably a video demonstrating how the app works.

Stay tuned&#8230;
