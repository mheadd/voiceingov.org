Next week, an event is being held in San Francisco to discuss the future of communications. The <a href="http://america.ecomm.ec/2010/" target="_blank">Emerging Communications Conference & Awards (eComm)</a> will bring together top executives from communications companies, innovators, academics, hackers and others to discuss &#8220;what&#8217;s next?&#8221; in telecom, mobile and Internet communications.

I&#8217;m thrilled and honored to be speaking at this event &#8211; I&#8217;ll be talking about how the Open Data and Gov 2.0 movements are <a href="http://america.ecomm.ec/2010/speakers/markheadd/" target="_blank">changing the way that people communicate</a> with their governments. But I&#8217;m even more thrilled to be an attendee at this event.

The <a href="http://america.ecomm.ec/2010/speakers/" target="_blank">speakers list</a> is like a who&#8217;s who of the telecom world, and I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing many of the presentations. (After eComm Europe in Amsterdam last year, I read some of the presentations that were given and was [mightily impressed with their quality and focus](http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=1314).)

If you&#8217;re in the San Francisco area, or are someone who is passionate about the changing landscape of communication technology, this is an event you should attend.

Hope to <a href="http://america.ecomm.ec/2010/register.php" target="_blank">see you there</a>.
