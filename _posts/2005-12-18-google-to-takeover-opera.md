Some interesting talk of late about the possibility of Google making a play for the Norwegian browser company Opera.

[Some analysts are speculating](http://www.pcworld.com/resource/article/0,aid,123948,pg,1,RSS,RSS,00.asp) that such an acquisition would support Google&#8217;s recent partnerships with Sun and the [OpenOffice.org](http://www.openoffice.org/) project, and align with its strategy to deliver office software functionality as a service through a browser interface. There is a lot for advocates of voice technologies to be enthusiastic about in such talks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and some things to be concerned about as well. 

Google clearly recognizes the value of using voice as a medium for delivering information, and for allowing users to interact with each other Ã¢â‚¬â€œ take a look at [Google Talk](http://www.google.com/talk/) (if you haven&#8217;t already). The possibilities of a pairing between Google with the browser company that has been at the forefront of helping further the development of the [XHTML+Voice](http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?page_id=13) standard are very exciting.

However, there are those speculating that such an acquisition could lead to the development of a Google-optimized browser:

> &#8220;Whilst it may be difficult for Google to make any direct income from acquiring a browser, there might be the advantage that the company could package a browser pre-configured with Google goodies that it could then attempt to get PC suppliers to preload as part of the machines&#8217; base install,&#8221; said Tony Lock, chief analyst with Bloor Research of the U.K.

I for one hope that if this happens, that the excellent [XHTML+Voice](http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?page_id=13) features that the developers at Opera have built in to their browser don&#8217;t get crowded out. If the folks at Google were smart (which they obviously are), they would find a way to leverage the X+V support in the Opera browser to further their [click-to-call](http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=71) strategy.

If Larry and Sergey decide to give me a ring, this is the advice I&#8217;ll be giving them. ðŸ˜‰
