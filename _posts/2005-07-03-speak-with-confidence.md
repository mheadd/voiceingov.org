I&#8217;ve posted a [new tutorial](http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?page_id=33) showing my take on the &#8220;Confidence-Based Confirmation&#8221; technique first outlined by [Matt Oshry](http://www.voicexmlreview.org/feb2005/columns/Feb2005_speak_listen.html) of TellMe networks. This example uses a VoiceXML subdialog approach to confirm caller utterances, and also leverages the new functionality provided by the VoiceXML 2.1 specification to record caller input while performing a recognition. This approach is critical to the use of [VoiceXML in telephone-based voting systems](http://vote.nist.gov/ecposstatements/phone_voting_whitepaper.doc). A complete overview and sample code are provided.
