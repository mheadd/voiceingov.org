Several weeks back, [I wrote a tutorial](http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?page_id=53) covering the basics of converting visual XHTML web pages into _superhappyfantastic_ [XHTML+Voice](http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?page_id=13) content using PHP.

Specifically, I made use of a PHP class library called [MiniXML](http://minixml.psychogenic.com/index.html) that works with PHP 4.x. Since the new version of PHP (Version 5) has now been out for a bit and is gaining support, I think it makes sense to leverage some of the new features of this latest release to do the same thing. I'm hoping this will be easier to do "“ in my original tutorial, I had to modify (read "hack") the underlying classes to get it to work the way I wanted.

To this end, I'm working on a new tutorial covering this same technique but using the new [DOM Functions](http://us2.php.net/manual/en/ref.dom.php) of PHP 5. Should be ready soon "“ stay tuned"¦
