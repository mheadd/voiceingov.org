A while back, I posted some information on [FCC-sanctioned abbreviated dialing designations](http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=51) (&#8220;N11&#8243;¬ù). One of the largest implementations of n11 &#8211; the City of New York&#8217;s 311 system &#8211; is about to get even bigger.

New York&#8217;s 311 system, which provides callers with government related information, will soon include information on social service programs administered by nonprofits. Read more in [Government Technology Magazine](http://www.govtech.net/news/news.php?id=97250).

What&#8217;s notable about this system, aside from the staggering number of calls it supports (an average of **43,000 calls** per day), is that it reportedly uses no automation. All calls are fielded by human operators and translation services are provided in 170 different languages.

That&#8217;s not to say that 311 systems (like other n11 systems) don&#8217;t provide ample opportunity for automation and speech technologies. A number of governments use VoiceXML as the foundation for their n11 systems but what works for one doesn&#8217;t necessarily work for all. 

Open standards like VoiceXML are [a good fit](http://www.destinationcrm.com/articles/default.asp?ArticleID=5306) in call centers of all types.
