Jon Oltsik has an [interesting article](http://news.com.com/Expect+a+Net+phone+evolution%2C+not+revolution/2010-1071_3-5837269.html?part=rss&tag=5837269&subj=news) up on CNET News about the current state of the VoIP &#8220;revolution.&#8221; He correctly points out some of the limitations that currently exist with VoIP service, which suggest that rumors of the demise of the <acronym title="Publicly Switched Telephone Network">PSTN</acronym> are greatly exaggerated.

> &#8220;We all complain about &#8216;Ma Bell,&#8217; but land-based dial tone almost always works. No one worries about voice quality or power&#8211;it just happens. Not so with VoIP. Network convergence has been a sexy topic for 10 years, but the fact is that most corporate networks were designed to simply pass data packets around willy-nilly, not guarantee carrier-quality voice service.&#8221;

As with most things, its all about keeping the proper perspective.
