A while ago, I wrote about [state and local governments using the Asterisk open source PBX](http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=114).

I just came across [this piece on Deb Bryant&#8217;s blog](http://www.bryantsblog.com/?p=9) about the State of Oregon using Asterisk for several projects. A case study describing the project is also provided.

I&#8217;ve got to do some more research in this area and see if there is an easy way to get a count of state and local governments using Asterisk. I have a feeling that the number is larger than most people would think, especially in light of the budget constraints facing governments in recent years.

Anyone have any thoughts?
