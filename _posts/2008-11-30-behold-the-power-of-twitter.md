The recent terrorist attack in Mumbai has <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2008/11/28/mumbai-twitter-sms-tech-internet-cx_bc_kn_1128mumbai.html?feed=rss_news" target="_blank">underscored the power of Twitter</a> to instantly provide firsthand information on events as they unfold.

But Twitter can be more than just a powerful new tool for citizen-journalists, it can also be a powerful tool for governments to use as part of an emergency notification system.

There are plenty of <a href="http://fly4change.wordpress.com/2008/06/26/the-governments-a-twitter-comprehensive-list-of-government-twitter-feeds/" target="_blank">government information feeds on Twitter</a>, but I&#8217;m wondering when a state or local government will integrate a Twitter feed into an emergency notification system to generate Tweets on natural disaster warnings, amber alerts, weather emergencies and other types of emergencies.

There is a Twitter feed for <a href="http://twitter.com/amberalert" target="_blank">Amber Alerts</a> that is maintained by <a href="http://amberalert.com/" target="_blank">AmberAlert.com</a> &#8211; although this isn&#8217;t a government agency, its exactly the idea I am referring to.

I hope some folks in law enforcement in state and local governments take notice.
