[This](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/28/technology/28phone.html?_r=1&ref=technology&oref=slogin) is big. To understand the root cause of this, one need only look to Mountain View, California (the headquarters of Google).

It was Google that pressed the FCC to [open up](http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/20070720_wireless.html) the auction on the 700 Mhz spectrum. And it was Google that got the ball rolling on the [Open Handset Alliance](http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/).

There is an interesting lesson that can be taken away from this:

Openness + Choice == Innovation!

Or, to quote Lowell McAdam, chief executive of Verizon Wireless:

> â€œThe trend we see here is an explosion of innovation. People want to take so much of whatâ€™s on the Internet and put it on the phone.â€

Lots of other places in the software world that could benefit from applying this philosophy.
