Last September, IBM made a notable contribution to the voice development community by [providing the Apache foundation](http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/09/20/1646226&tid=89) with a set of reusable dialog components for creating voice and multimodal applications. While some at the time criticized the contribution as &#8220;discardware,&#8221; the folks at Apache recently announced that [version 1.0 of the Reusable Dialog Component Taglib](http://jakarta.apache.org/site/news/news-2005-q3.html#20050726.1) is now available for use by developers.

How useful these components are for aiding the rapid development of voice applications remains to be seen &#8211; a lot is riding on how developers react to this news.

There are other efforts out there to make developing voice applications generally, and VoiceXML applications specifically, more efficient. There is a set of PHP libraries [available on SourceForge](http://vxml.sourceforge.net/) for creating VoiceXML/CCXML/SRGS applications. My own meager contribution to this broader effort is a [small PHP class library](http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?page_id=16) that can be used to generate SRGS grammars in XML format.

Hopefully, we are only seeing the beginning of a broader and more sustained effort to simplify voice application development.
