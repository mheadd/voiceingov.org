Just got an email informing me of a new devloper release of <a href="http://www.voiceobjects.com/en/products/index.html" target="_blank">VoiceObjects</a> (version 7.4).Â  This bit caught my attention:

> **Support for 2-way SMS dialogs**
  
> VoiceObjects 7.4 has expanded the text channel so that in addition to USSD dialogs, text messaging from mobile devices using the Short Message Service (SMS) is now supported&#8230;

Wow! If you&#8217;re a developer and that doesn&#8217;t get your juices flowing then you may want to get yourself checked out.

I&#8217;m going to download the new version today and start playing around with 2-way SMS messaging.
