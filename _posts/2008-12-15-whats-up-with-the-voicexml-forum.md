Their <a href="http://www.voicexml.org/" target="_blank">website</a> has not been updated in a long time, nor has a related site &#8211; <a href="http://www.voicexml.org/Review/index.html" target="_blank">VoiceXML Review</a> (which actually used to have some pretty cool articles).

Their message board used to have some very good discussions, and developers would visit often to connect with others working thorough challenges in developing voice applications. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s been inactive for some time.

It would be good to see some activity from this organization, particularly on the multi-modal front. The VoiceXML Forum had been spearheading the development of the <a href="http://www.voicexml.org/specs/multimodal/index.html" target="_blank">XHTML+Voice</a> standard, which appears to have <a href="http://www.voicexml.org/spec.html" target="_blank">been dormant</a> for some time.

Did I miss a memo or something? What&#8217;s the deal? Somebody help me out.
