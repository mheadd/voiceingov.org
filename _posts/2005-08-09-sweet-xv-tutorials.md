I found a couple of very nice X+V tutorials on the IBM developerWorks site that walk readers through the development of a voice-based SMS sending application. All that&#8217;s required is an editor (my favorite Windows editor is [HTML Kit](http://www.chami.com/html-kit/))** and a copy of the [Opera Browser](http://www.opera.com/) (version 8.0).

The [first piece](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/wireless/library/wi-message.html) gently introduces readers to the idea of developing an X+V application, and [the second](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/wireless/library/wi-send.html) elaborates on the initial example by introducing the concept of a [mixed initiative](http://studio.tellme.com/vxml2/mixed/howto/mixed.html) dialog.

Multimodal applications hold enormous potential for improving government service delivery by enabling a broader array of input options for web-based services. This is a nice introduction to the concept of multimodality, and a good way to get your hands a little dirty with X+V. Plus the download of Opera 8.0 is free (if you donâ€™t mind looking at a few ads as a tradeoff for integrated voice functionality &#8212; I don&#8217;t).

Good stuff. Bravo, Mr. Kusnitz! Bravo!

> ** The voice extensions for the Opera Browser are currently not supported on Linux, so youâ€™ll have to download the Windows version. You can create the X+V content on another platform, and host it there if you like. If your looking for a good Linux-based editor, you might try [this one](http://quanta.kdewebdev.org/).
