<div id="content">  
  <p>Here is a <a href="http://enterprise.linux.com/enterprise/06/10/03/2037223.shtml?tid=101">great story</a> about how an education agency in Chicago is using Asterisk and VoIP telephony to lower costs.</p>

<p>I’ve got an Asterisk server running at home now, but I have not yet had the time to give it the attention it deserves. Also came across a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/voxy">VoiceXML plugin for Asterisk</a> on SourceForge recently that looks interesting. Itching to try that one…</p>
