  <p>With services like <a href="http://www.bewell.com/" target="_blank">bewell.com</a> and <a href="http://www.americanwell.com/index.html" target="_blank">americanwell.com</a> popping up, it looks as if our interactions with doctors and medical professionals will increasingly take place on the Internet.</p>

<p>Whether its through the Facebook-like groups of BeWell (referred to as “expert-guided communities”), or through a web camera (i.e., the “virtual house call” pitched by American Well), the quality of a person’s Internet connection may one day soon have a meaningful impact on the quality of medical information that person receives.</p>

<p>These new interactive medical services follow the unveiling of other web-based health services from both <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en-US/health/about/index.html" target="_blank">Google</a> and Microsoft.</p>

<p>As health care services become increasingly web-based, the problem of the digital divide generally, and the <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/220/report_display.asp" target="_blank">broadband divide</a> specifically, will become more acute.</p>

<p>This is an area where we could use some original thinking, and some fresh ideas. Public policy leaders need to step up on this one – it ain’t going to fix itself.</p>
