      <h1> Waxing Nostalgic on VoIP</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>There is an old maxim in the fashion business that says that everything comes back into style eventually. (I’ll prove it — I never thought Iâ€™d be wearing wide-bottom jeans again, but here we are.)</p>

<p>This same principle can be applied to technology. Who would have thought that <a href="http://uk.builder.com/0,39026540,39214317,00.htm">mainframes would make a comeback</a>? Who would have thought that the richness of more traditional desktop client-server applications (as opposed to the relatively sparser GUIâ€™s of web-based applications) would <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">come back into vogue</a>?</p>

<p>And so it is with voice technologies. When I read about the latest Voice over IM development (for example, <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1817029,00.asp">this one</a>, and <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/3531216">this one here</a>, and of course <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/communications/0,39020336,39214652,00.htm">this one</a>), I canâ€™t help but think about the early days of VoIP. Remember when the only way to use VoIP was on your PC â€“ before <a href="http://www.vonage.com/">Vonage</a> or the other providers brought VoIP to your telephone? I came across this neat article on the <a href="http://www.voipreview.org/news.details.aspx?nid=51">history of VoIP</a> as I was reminiscing that provides a good description of the early days.</p>

<p>So it looks like VoIP has advanced to the point where its making a comback on the PC…? Weird.</p>
