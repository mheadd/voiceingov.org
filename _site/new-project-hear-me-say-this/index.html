      <h1> New Project: Hear Me Say This</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>I haven’t been blogging much of late because of a new project I have been working on — <em><a href="http://hearmesaythis.org/" target="_blank">Hear Me Say This</a></em>.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://hearmesaythis.org/" target="_blank">Hear Me Say This</a></em> is a web application that uses the Sunlight Labs API, the Twitter API and the plain old telephone to empower citizens to send a message to the people that represent them in Congress.</p>

<p>The application uses the <a href="http://www.voxeo.com/free/" target="_blank">Voxeo Prophecy platform</a> to support the VoiceXML and CCXML components it uses, and is hosted on a lean and mean Ubuntu web server. The back end is written in PHP 5 and uses a MySQL database. Its open source, and uses the latest open standards for developing telephone applications.</p>

<p>I’ve entered this application in the Sunlight Labs “<a href="http://www.sunlightlabs.com/appsforamerica/" target="_blank">Apps for America</a>” contest — I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the number of telephone apps entered in this contest (the others all appear to be Asterisk-based, mine is the only CCXML/VoiceXML-based app).</p>

<p>Now that the project is done, and my entry has been submitted, I’m focused on adding features and spreading the word. If you’re interested in testing it out, <a href="mailto:mheadd@voiceingov.org">give me a shout</a>.</p>

<p>One of the other things I’d like to do in the weeks ahead is to convert the voice portion of this application to use Voxeo’s new <a href="http://www.tropo.com/" target="_blank">Tropo</a> platform. Since the back end of the app is written in PHP, and since Tropo supports writing voice apps in PHP I think it would be an interesting experiment to rewrite the existing CCXML/VoiceXML pieces as PHP/Tropo components.</p>

<p>I think this will provide a nice way of comparing and contrasting voice applications built using the more (ahem) traditional VoiceXML route vs. the new hotness that is Tropo.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>
