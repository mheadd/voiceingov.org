      <h1> NYC 311 Getting Bigger</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>A while back, I posted some information on <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=51">FCC-sanctioned abbreviated dialing designations</a> (“N11″). One of the largest implementations of n11 – the City of New York’s 311 system – is about to get even bigger.</p>

<p>New York’s 311 system, which provides callers with government related information, will soon include information on social service programs administered by nonprofits. Read more in <a href="http://www.govtech.net/news/news.php?id=97250">Government Technology Magazine</a>.</p>

<p>What’s notable about this system, aside from the staggering number of calls it supports (an average of <strong>43,000 calls</strong> per day), is that it reportedly uses no automation. All calls are fielded by human operators and translation services are provided in 170 different languages.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that 311 systems (like other n11 systems) don’t provide ample opportunity for automation and speech technologies. A number of governments use VoiceXML as the foundation for their n11 systems but what works for one doesn’t necessarily work for all.</p>

<p>Open standards like VoiceXML are <a href="http://www.destinationcrm.com/articles/default.asp?ArticleID=5306">a good fit</a> in call centers of all types.</p>
