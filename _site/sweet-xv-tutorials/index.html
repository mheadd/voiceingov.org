      <h1> Sweet X+V Tutorials</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>I found a couple of very nice X+V tutorials on the IBM developerWorks site that walk readers through the development of a voice-based SMS sending application. All that’s required is an editor (my favorite Windows editor is <a href="http://www.chami.com/html-kit/">HTML Kit</a>)** and a copy of the <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera Browser</a> (version 8.0).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/wireless/library/wi-message.html">first piece</a> gently introduces readers to the idea of developing an X+V application, and <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/wireless/library/wi-send.html">the second</a> elaborates on the initial example by introducing the concept of a <a href="http://studio.tellme.com/vxml2/mixed/howto/mixed.html">mixed initiative</a> dialog.</p>

<p>Multimodal applications hold enormous potential for improving government service delivery by enabling a broader array of input options for web-based services. This is a nice introduction to the concept of multimodality, and a good way to get your hands a little dirty with X+V. Plus the download of Opera 8.0 is free (if you donâ€™t mind looking at a few ads as a tradeoff for integrated voice functionality — I don’t).</p>

<p>Good stuff. Bravo, Mr. Kusnitz! Bravo!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>** The voice extensions for the Opera Browser are currently not supported on Linux, so youâ€™ll have to download the Windows version. You can create the X+V content on another platform, and host it there if you like. If your looking for a good Linux-based editor, you might try <a href="http://quanta.kdewebdev.org/">this one</a>.</p>
