      <h1> First Draft of VoiceXML 3.0 Released</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>The W3C has released the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-voicexml30-20081219/" target="_blank">First Public Working Draft of Voice Extensible Markup Language (VoiceXML) 3.0</a>. This is the next version of the VoiceXML language that reportedly will include a host of new features, including speaker authentication.</p>

<p>Although this is an early draft, according to the document:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By the middle of 2009 the group expects to have all existing functionality defined in detail, the new functionality stubbed out, and the VoiceXML 2.1 profile largely defined. By late-2009 the group expects to have all functionality defined and both profiles defined in detail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Iâ€™ve got to find some time to go through this document â€” in addition to being a very interesting read, it might be kind of neat to provide input that might get incorporated into the standard by the W3C.</p>

<p>Guess I know what Iâ€™ll be doing for New Yearâ€™s Eve. ðŸ˜‰</p>
