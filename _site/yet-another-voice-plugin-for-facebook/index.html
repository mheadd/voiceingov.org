      <h1> Yet Another Voice Plugin for Facebook</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>I’ve been enamored of late with <a href="http://www.grandcentral.com/">GrandCentral</a>, the very cool web phone service recently acquired by Google (which makes it even more cool I guess).</p>

<p>GrandCentral isn’t a standard phone service provider — they require you to get your phone service from somewhere else. What GrandCentral excels at is providing a way to “front end” a number of different phones (home, business, cell) with a single number that you can choose. This lets you control how calls from different friends and family (or even perfect strangers) get routed between your phones.</p>

<p>For example, some contacts can get routed to your home phone, some to your cell — depending on who they are and how you set up where calls go. One of <a href="http://www.grandcentral.com/support/howitworks/">the options</a> that is provided is to route calls to a <a href="http://www.grandcentral.com/howitworks/gizmo">soft phone from the Gizmo Project</a>. In a nutshell, this lets you route calls from the PSTN — using a number in your area code, mind you — to the SIP phone running on your computer (either Linux or Windows, as Gizmo runs on both). How cool is that?</p>

<p>You can imagine my excitement when I learned that there is a GrandCentral plugin for facebook — it basically adds a “Call Me” button to your <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=527353413">facebook profile</a>.</p>

<p>While this is cool, I <a href="http://pulverblog.pulver.com/archives/007455.html">already have a voice application</a> enabled in my facebook profile. So now I’ve got two of them…</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I’ve not received a single call yet. Not sure if it’s me, or if people just aren’t ready to use voice applications from within Facebook.</p>

<p>Maybe I need more friends.</p>
