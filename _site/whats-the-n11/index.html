      <h1> What&#8217;s the N11?</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>Seems like more people are familiar with the concept of abbreviated dialing designations because of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000002OME/104-1244522-1205504?v=glance">Mary J. Blige</a> than anything the FCC has put out. Still, the FCC has put together a <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Common_Carrier/News_Releases/2000/nrc0036a.html">very nice summary</a> explaining Abbreviated Dialing Codes (sometimes referred to as N11) that is worth a read from those working in the public sector.</p>

<p>More and more state governments are starting to implement systems based on N11 designations – the State of Utah has a VoiceXML-based 511 system, as does the <a href="http://www.virginiadot.org/infoservice/news/CO02152002-511.asp">State of Virginia</a> (I believe both are using the TellMe platform). The <a href="http://www.govtech.net/news/news.php?id=96339">State of Oklahoma</a> is now doing some interesting things with 211.</p>

<p>Rollout of systems based on these designations is still somewhat uneven — organizations advocating for the adoption of <a href="http://www.deploy511.org/deploystatus.htm">511</a> and <a href="http://www.211.org/status.html">211</a> systems track implementations closely. Let’s hope that as more and more states deploy systems, they will build them using open standards. Mary’s got no love for vendor lock in.</p>
