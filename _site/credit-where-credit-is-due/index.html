  <p>Itâ€™s nice to see that the State of Delaware is <a href="http://www.gcn.com/print/25_32/42505-1.html" target="_blank">still receiving acclaim</a> for the Access Delaware project that I helped start several years ago with <a href="http://www.state.de.us/ltgov/default.shtml" target="_blank">Lt. Governor John Carney</a>. After itâ€™s initial launch, the project was selected as an award winner in the Accenture/MIT Digital Government Award program â€” one of the first national technology awards the State of Delaware ever received.</p>

<p>Thanks to a core group of dedicated programmers in the Department of Technology and Information, and the support of forward-thinking public officials like John Carney, the project continues to evolve and improve.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s interesting to go back now and <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/media/wdel_com_interview.htm">listen to an interview</a> I gave when the program was first launched. Iâ€™m amazed, and very proud that the program is still being recognized. Now, if only more governments would follow this leadâ€¦ ðŸ˜‰</p>
