  <p>This month promises to be an important one for the advancement of open standards for voice applications.</p>

<p>The World Wide Web Consortium is <a href="http://www.w3.org/Voice/#plan" target="_blank">scheduled to publish</a> the CCXML 1.0 standard as a “Candidate Recommendation” this month, an important step in the advancement of this standard and the first change in its status in some time (the standard has been stalled in “Last Call Working Draft” status since January of 1997).</p>

<p>I and other voice application developers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of this milestone. The time has come to move this important standard forward.</p>
