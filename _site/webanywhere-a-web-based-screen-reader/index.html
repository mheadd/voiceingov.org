      <h1> WebAnywhere:  A Web-Based Screen Reader</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>Just happened upon a story <a href="http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleID=42563">from the University of Washington News</a> describing a project to build a web-based screen reader — called <a href="http://webanywhere.cs.washington.edu/">WebAnywhere</a> — to allow the visually impaired to surf the web.</p>

<p>Most people have heard of or even tried <a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs_products/software_jaws.asp">screen readers like Jaws</a>. The problem with software like Jaws is that it must be installed and run on the computer a visual impaired person is using. This can be inconvenient if someone is traveling, or is otherwise away from home or work.</p>

<p>WebAnywhere is different in that it is web-based, so there is no software to install. Any computer can be made more accessible to the visually impaired as long as it has a browser. The software that runs WebAnywhere is available for review from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/webanywhere/">Google Code</a>.</p>

<p>This sounds like an outstanding project — I’ll have to pull the source code down and take a look at it.</p>
