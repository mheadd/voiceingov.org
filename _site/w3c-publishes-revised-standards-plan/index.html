      <h1> W3C Publishes Revised Standards Plan</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>New on the W3C Voice Browser Activity site is the addition of a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Voice/#plan">new schedule</a> for the release of some major voice application standards. There is some very cool stuff on tap for 2008.</p>

<p>First, it looks like the Call Control eXtensible Markup Language (CCXML) will finally reach full recommendation status next year. The last call working draft was first published in June of 2005. I’ve been jonesin’ for this one <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=112">for a while</a>.</p>

<p>Those looking for an easy to install yet powerful CCXML platform can try out the <a href="http://voxeo.com/prophecy/">Prophecy platform</a> from Voxeo. The one downside is that it only runs on Windows, but it already supports most of the functionality laid out in the most recent CCXML last call working draft (released in January of 2007). Those looking to run a CCXML interpreter on *NIX based systems can try the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/oktopous/">Oktopous</a> platform.</p>

<p>Second, and maybe even more exciting, the first public working draft of VoiceXML 3.0 is expected to be released early next year. According to the W3C, VoiceXML 3.0 will:</p>

<p>“…provide enhancements to existing dialog and media control, as well as major new features (e.g. modularization, a cleaner separation between data/flow/dialog, and asynchronous external eventing) to facilitate interoperability with external applications and media components.”</p>

<p>Looks like the new year will be a happy one for voice application developers!</p>
