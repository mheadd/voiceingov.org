      <h1> Candidate Recommendation Status for VXML 2.1</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>VoiceXML 2.1 received “Candidate Recommendation” status from the W3C on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/CR-voicexml21-20050613/">June 13th</a>, taking it <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/Process-20040205/tr.html#maturity-levels">one step closer</a> to the level of a formal standard.</p>

<p>There are a number of extremely cool features in the new specification that will make building dynamic voice applications with VoiceXML simpler and more efficient. A good overview of these new features can be found in the “First Words” column authored by Rob Marchand for the <a href="http://www.voicexmlreview.org/Sep2004/columns/sep2004_first_words.html">VoiceXML Review</a>.</p>

<p>Despite the relatively early stage in the process, most of the larger VoiceXML platform vendors now support most (if not all) the new functionality spelled out in the 2.1 specification.</p>
