      <h1> Idaho 511</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>It looks like the <a href="http://511.idaho.gov">State of Idaho</a> is the <a href="http://www.govtech.net/news/news.php?id=97410">latest state</a> to implement a 511 traveler information service. Not a lot of information available on the technology used, but the system appears to accept both voice and <acronym title="Dual Tone Multi Frequency">DTMF</acronym> input. It also appears that Idaho is partnering with other states in reserving phone lines for the system, to help spread the cost.</p>

<p>Idaho is the <a href="http://www.deploy511.org/deploystatus.htm">24th state</a> to implement a 511 system.</p>
