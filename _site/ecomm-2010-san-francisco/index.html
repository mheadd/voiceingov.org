      <h1> eComm 2010: San Francisco</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>Next week, an event is being held in San Francisco to discuss the future of communications. The <a href="http://america.ecomm.ec/2010/" target="_blank">Emerging Communications Conference &amp; Awards (eComm)</a> will bring together top executives from communications companies, innovators, academics, hackers and others to discuss “what’s next?” in telecom, mobile and Internet communications.</p>

<p>I’m thrilled and honored to be speaking at this event – I’ll be talking about how the Open Data and Gov 2.0 movements are <a href="http://america.ecomm.ec/2010/speakers/markheadd/" target="_blank">changing the way that people communicate</a> with their governments. But I’m even more thrilled to be an attendee at this event.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://america.ecomm.ec/2010/speakers/" target="_blank">speakers list</a> is like a who’s who of the telecom world, and I’m looking forward to hearing many of the presentations. (After eComm Europe in Amsterdam last year, I read some of the presentations that were given and was <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=1314">mightily impressed with their quality and focus</a>.)</p>

<p>If you’re in the San Francisco area, or are someone who is passionate about the changing landscape of communication technology, this is an event you should attend.</p>

<p>Hope to <a href="http://america.ecomm.ec/2010/register.php" target="_blank">see you there</a>.</p>
