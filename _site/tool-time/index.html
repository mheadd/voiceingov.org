      <h1> Tool Time</h1>

  <p>It has been said that â€œa bad workman always blames his tools.â€ With this in mind, Iâ€™m always on the lookout for the <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?page_id=18">right tool</a> to develop VoiceXML applications. I consider myself pretty open to trying new things, and there is an interesting article in the recent issue of VoiceXML Review discussing the <a href="http://www.voicexml.org/Review/Jun2005/features/eclipse.html">Eclipse Voice Tools Project</a>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve dabbled with Eclipse in the past while reading some interesting articles about <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-wxxm18/index.html">using it for XSL Transformations</a>, but most of what Iâ€™ve heard about this tool comes from the Java developers I work with. There donâ€™t seem to be any mild feelings â€“ they either love it, or hate it.</p>

<p>Lacking that level of emotional investment, it seems worth a try to at least test Eclipse out as a tool for developing VoiceXML applications. There is a nice <a href="http://www.developer.com/java/other/article.php/3518006">introductory article</a> on Eclipse just up recently on Developer.com that might provide some nice background for anyone interested in learning more about this tool.</p>

<p>By the way, if your thinking that investing some time to check out Eclipse might be a waste given that you donâ€™t do a lot of (or even any) Java development, this tool has a lot more to offer. I do all of my server side stuff in PHP, and there is an <a href="http://www.phpeclipse.de/tiki-view_articles.php">interesting plug-in</a> for Eclipse that supports PHP development.</p>

<p>Additionally, IBM is releasing a <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/ettk">cluster of development tools</a> (dubbed the â€œEmerging Technologies Tool Kitâ€) as plug-ins for Eclipse. Given the wide spectrum of development that Eclipse supports, this tool seems like a good choice for voice developers (and others) to have in their toolkit.</p>
