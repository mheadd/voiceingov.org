      <h1> Phoning up some controversy</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>It’s interesting to see the part that automated outbound calling applications (or “robo calls” as they are more commonly referred to) are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/07/us/politics/07robo.html?_r=1&amp;ref=politics&amp;oref=slogin" target="_blank">playing in the election</a> taking place today.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it looks like for the most part they are not being used very scrupulously:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Political messages are exempt from the federal do-not-call rules meant to discourage unwanted sales pitches. But a New Hampshire law prohibits making automated calls to people who are on the do-not-call list. The Republican committee agreed on Sunday to halt calls there at the urging of the state attorney general.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven’t gotten that many calls, but for the next election I’ll be getting my <a href="http://nerdvittles.com/index.php?p=75" target="_blank">Asterisk set up</a> configured to block this kind of nonsense.</p>
