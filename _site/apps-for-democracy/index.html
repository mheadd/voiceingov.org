  <p>The District of Columbia is sponsoring an innovative contest to encourage developers to build applications that utilize data published on everything from <a href="http://data.octo.dc.gov/" target="_blank">crime locations to building permits</a>.</p>

<p>The development contest — <a href="http://www.appsfordemocracy.org/" target="_blank">Apps for Democracy</a> — is currently underway, and concludes on November 12th.</p>

<p>I’ve signed up for this contest and will be submitting an application for consideration — I’ll be building a multimodal application using <a href="http://www.voxeo.com/prophecy/" target="_blank">Voxeo Prophecy</a> and the <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?page_id=41">HAWHAW PHP library</a>. I hope to have it done by the end of the week and will post details here, and probably a video demonstrating how the app works.</p>

<p>Stay tuned…</p>
