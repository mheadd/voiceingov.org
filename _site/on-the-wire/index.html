  <p>Googleâ€™s <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3518341">decision to invest</a> in a company focusing on delivering broadband Internet access over power lines (often referred to as â€œBPLâ€ â€“ Broadband over Power Line, or “PLC” â€“ Power Line Communications) was the first in what appears to be a one-two punch for BPL this week. Itâ€™s now being reported that IBM is <a href="http://news.com.com/IBM+partners+to+offer+broadband+from+a+wall+plug/2100-1034_3-5782194.html?tag=nefd.top">also making an investment</a> in BPL via a company called CenterPoint Energy in Houston, TX.</p>

<p>The advent of <a href="http://www.upaplc.org/">widespread BPL access</a> creates an interesting possibility of a new way of providing <acronym title="Voice over Internet Protocol">VoIP</acronym> telephone service. It also suggests the possibility of new players in the VoIP space (i.e., power companies). This is interesting for many reasons â€“ states and local government have a <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/programs/energy/EleIndReg.htm">revenue and regulatory stake</a> in the power industry, and the field of VoIP providers is getting uncomfortably crowded given that there <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,118193,00.asp">isnâ€™t a clear regulatory picture</a> as yet.</p>

<p>This is another good indicator that states and local governments need to constantly evaluate their revenue and regulatory environments in light of new advances in technology. Governments that donâ€™t take these proactive steps <a href="http://governing.com/articles/4voip.htm">risk being left out</a> in the cold as new ways of delivering old services emerge.</p>
