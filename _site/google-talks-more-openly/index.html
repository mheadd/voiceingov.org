  <p><a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google Talk</a> — the IM and VoIP client from the Internet search giant — is now capable of interacting with a larger range of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jabber_clients">different clients</a> because of enhancements to its interoperability.</p>

<p>Google Talk is built on the open <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/">XMPP specification</a>, but when it was originally released several months back it was restricted for use with other Google Talk clients. The <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3578196">recently announced</a> enhancements will make it possible for Google Talk to connect with other Jabber-based clients.</p>

<p>This is a major step forward, not only for Google Talk but for open standards that promote interoperability. Nice!</p>

<p>Also, For anyone with an interest in building IM apps that will now be able to connect with Google Talk, check out the <a href="http://cjphp.netflint.net/">PHP Jabber Class</a>. It’s still a relatively young project, but I’ve found it useful for banging out prototypes of VoiceXML / IM applications. Worth a look.</p>
