  <p>The New York Times is <a href="http://tech.nytimes.com/2005/07/12/technology/12auto.html">reporting on an Australian-based study</a> examining the link between cell phone usage and traffic accidents. It suggests that using a “hands free” phone does not aid in traffic safety, calling into question <a href="http://www.ghsa.org/html/stateinfo/laws/cellphone_laws.html">laws allowing the use of hands free devices</a> in cars while driving.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There just doesn’t seem to be any safety benefit by restricting drivers to hands-free phones,” said Rae Tyson, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. “It’s the cognitive overload that sometimes occurs when you’re engaging in a conversation that is the source of the distraction more so than the manipulation of the device.”</p>

<p>The actual study appears in the <a href="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/">British Medical Journal</a> – should be an interesting read.</p>
