      <h1> Migrating to Drupal</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>Over the next week or two, I’ll be moving <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org">this blog</a> to a new host and migrating to <a href="http://drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a>.</p>

<p>My experience with Drupal is limited to some work I did for a friend (and the current <a href="http://ltgov.delaware.gov/" target="_blank">Lt. Governor of Delaware</a>) some months ago, and also <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=544">some tinkering</a> on my own time. I’d like to be more proficient in Drupal and start developing my own custom modules, so I’ll be jumping in with both feet and porting this site over in the near future.</p>

<p>I still love <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> (it rocks!) but I feel like its time to move on up the CMS food chain a bit. Stay tuned for tips and lessons learned from the migration.</p>
