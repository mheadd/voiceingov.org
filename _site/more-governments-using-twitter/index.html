      <h1> More Governments Using Twitter</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>I posted a few weeks ago about the <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=154" target="_blank">potential that Twitter has to assist governments</a> in disseminating information. Since then, Iâ€™ve come across lots of stories on how governments are using Twitter for everything from traffic notifications to press releases to public meeting notices.</p>

<p>Government Technology has <a href="http://www.govtech.com/gt/articles/423688" target="_blank">an interesting piece</a> on how the State of Washington is using Twitter.</p>

<p>If you know of an interesting use of Twitter by a public sector organization, post a link to it in the comments section.</p>
