  <p><a href="http://www.govtech.com/gt/articles/640438" target="_blank">Government Technology Magazine</a> is reporting on the reaction of state and local government IT officials to the recent decision of Microsoft to <a href="http://www.govtech.com/gt/articles/640438" target="_blank">discontinue support</a> for Windows XP and Office 2003:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft dropped free support this week for Windows XP and Office 2003, leaving state and local governments wondering when they’ll be forced to move computers to a newer operating system.</p>

  <p>Lisa Moorehead, the director of management information systems in the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, said her department doesn’t have the budget to pay for repeated incident-report calls.</p>

  <p>“That is going to pose huge problems to us and force us to potentially go to an operating system we don’t want to go to,” said Moorhead, who isn’t thrilled with one of her other options: the newer Windows Vista operating system.</p>

<p>So, what other options to state and local IT officials have? Let me spell it out for you:</p>
