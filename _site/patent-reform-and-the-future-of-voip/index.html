  <p><a href="http://news.com.com/Is+cable+in+Verizons+crosshairs/2100-7352_3-6175725.html?tag=st.prev" target="_blank">Interesting article</a> on the recent patent infringement ruling against Vonage, and how it could potentially impact other VoIP providers.</p>

<p>It underscores the real need to <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9593_22-5862506.html" target="_blank">overhaul the current U.S. patent system</a>. In the words of Gerald Faulhaber, a professor in the business and public policy department for The Wharton School of Business (quoted in the article):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It has gotten out of control. People are getting patents for all kinds of crazy stuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amen, Professor!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Seems that Vonage has set up their own protest site. See it <a href="http://www1.freetocompete.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
