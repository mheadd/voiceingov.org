      <h1> The Ghost of Thomas Edison</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>The Township of Edison, New Jersey recently provided <a href="http://ems.gmnews.com/news/2005/0727/Front_page/009.html">a poignant example</a> in how not to practice voting by telephone.</p>

<p>It seems an Edison Township Council member was away at a boy scout camp when an ordinance authorizing the lease of almost 30 police cars came before the Council for a vote. The Council member in question <a href="http://ems.gmnews.com/news/2005/0727/Front_page/009.html">attempted to participate</a> in the vote via speaker phone. After other Council members expressed frustration over the poor sound quality (and also questioned the legality of participating in a vote of Council by remote means), the action was tabled for a future meeting.</p>

<p>There is some hidden irony in this incident â€” audio quality is just one of many factors that can negatively impact perceptions of voice applications, or phone-based services. Edison, New Jersey takes its name from the famous inventor Thomas Alva Edison, who resided in Menlo Park during the late 1800â€™s. During his time there, Edison invented the first device to record spoken audio â€” the phonograph. Edison was also instrumental in making <a href="http://www.ieee-virtual-museum.org/collection/tech.php?id=2345870&amp;lid=1">critical improvements to the telephone</a> to improve sound quality.</p>

<p>Seems Edison, New Jersey should aspire to be more like its famous namesake and focus on better sound quality. Iâ€™ll volunteer my services should they decide to ever deploy a VoiceXML application. ðŸ˜‰</p>
