      <h1> Bad Week for Public Sector CIOs</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>In Delaware, the past week saw a State Auditor report released that showed <a href="http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20090311/NEWS/90311062" target="_blank">inappropriate use of state credit cards</a> by the former State CIO and several of his top staff members.</p>

<p>Now, in Washington, newly appointed federal CIO Vivek Kundra has <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=335877" target="_blank">taken a leave of absence</a> after FBI agents raided his former office (a week after he left) and arrested an office employee in a bribery scandal.</p>

<p>An altogether bad week for public sector CIOs. If the way that governments use technology is to be reformed, public sector CIOs will simply have to do better than this.</p>

<p>What a shame.</p>
