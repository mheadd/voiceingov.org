      <h1> VoiceGlue Up And Running</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>I now have <a href="http://www.voiceglue.org/" target="_blank">VoiceGlue</a> up and running on Ubuntu 8.10. (Actually, the Ubuntu server is running as a virtual machine under Sun’s VirtualBox 2.1.)</p>

<p>For those that don’t know, <a href="http://www.voiceglue.org/" target="_blank">VoiceGlue</a> is an open source project that links <a href="http://www.asterisk.org/" target="_blank">Asterisk</a> (the open source PBX) with <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/openvxi/index.html" target="_blank">OpenVXI</a> (an open source VoiceXML platform currently under the stewardship of Vocalocity). VoiceGlue makes it possible for Asterisk users to deploy a completely open source VoiceXML platform for building IVRs and other useful applications.</p>

<p>The VoiceGlue install on Ubuntu 8.10 went smoothly — I did <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=730">run into an issue</a> with one of the services not starting, but that was easily identified and fixed thanks to a speedy response from the VoiceGlue folks. (This issue was really my own fault — use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">pgrep</code> command to make sure you have specific services running. And when in doubt, check the logs people!)</p>

<p>Based on my experience with the install and my initial testing I am extremely impressed with VoiceGlue. Its <a href="http://voiceglue.org/wiki/doku.php" target="_blank">well documented</a> and there is an <a href="http://www.voiceglue.org/pipermail/voiceglue/" target="_blank">active community of users</a> offering tips and troubleshooting advice.</p>

<p>Hats off to the people behind VoiceGlue — Doug Campbell and Steve Smith. Well done!</p>
