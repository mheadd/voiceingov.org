      <h1> More Public Sector Asterisk</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>A while ago, I wrote about <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=114">state and local governments using the Asterisk open source PBX</a>.</p>

<p>I just came across <a href="http://www.bryantsblog.com/?p=9">this piece on Deb Bryant’s blog</a> about the State of Oregon using Asterisk for several projects. A case study describing the project is also provided.</p>

<p>I’ve got to do some more research in this area and see if there is an easy way to get a count of state and local governments using Asterisk. I have a feeling that the number is larger than most people would think, especially in light of the budget constraints facing governments in recent years.</p>

<p>Anyone have any thoughts?</p>
