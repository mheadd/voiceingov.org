      <h1> New Tutorial Coming Soon</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>Several weeks back, <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?page_id=53">I wrote a tutorial</a> covering the basics of converting visual XHTML web pages into <em>superhappyfantastic</em> <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?page_id=13">XHTML+Voice</a> content using PHP.</p>

<p>Specifically, I made use of a PHP class library called <a href="http://minixml.psychogenic.com/index.html">MiniXML</a> that works with PHP 4.x. Since the new version of PHP (Version 5) has now been out for a bit and is gaining support, I think it makes sense to leverage some of the new features of this latest release to do the same thing. Iâ€™m hoping this will be easier to do â€“ in my original tutorial, I had to modify (read â€œhackâ€) the underlying classes to get it to work the way I wanted.</p>

<p>To this end, Iâ€™m working on a new tutorial covering this same technique but using the new <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/ref.dom.php">DOM Functions</a> of PHP 5. Should be ready soon â€“ stay tunedâ€¦</p>
