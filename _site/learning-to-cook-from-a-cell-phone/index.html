<div id="content">  
  <p>It’s not easy to find someone more obsessed with phones than me.</p>

  <p>It has become the kitchen tool of choice for chefs and home cooks. They use it to keep grocery lists, find recipes, photograph their handiwork, look up the names of French cheeses, set timers for steak and soft-boiled eggs, and convert European or English measurements to American ones.</p>

  <p>“It taught me to cook, really,” said Kelli Howell, a college sophomore in Chicago, of her Nokia phone.</p>
