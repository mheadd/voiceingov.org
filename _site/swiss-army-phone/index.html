      <h1> Swiss Army Phone</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>Iâ€™m not sure who first observed that cell phones are fast becoming the Swiss Army knives of personal communications, but anyone who doubts this should pay attentions to some recent developments.</p>

<p>Both <a href="http://www.google.com/sms/">Google</a> and <a href="http://news.com.com/Yahoo+expands+its+mobile+search+functions/2100-1038_3-5777296.html">Yahoo!</a> Are getting serious about bringing powerful search functionality to cell phones through <acronym title="Short message service">SMS</acronym>. Google looks to bring <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/web_search.html">full on web-based searching</a> to cell phones in the near future. Cell â€œphonesâ€ is becoming something of a misnomer â€“ these devices are turning into (or have already, as some would argue) sophisticated <a href="http://tuxmobil.org/pda_linux_apps_java.html">application environments</a> that can be used to deliver all types of information to users through a staggering array of channels (voice, e-mail, text message, IM, etc.) These are just of a few of the indicators that radical changes may be under way in how people use cell phones.</p>

<p>Given this trend, it makes sense for governments to be aware of how the taxes they impose on telecommunications can influence activity. If you believe the old adage that â€œthe only (legal) way to avoid taxes is to change behaviorâ€ then there is a powerful message in these recent developments for government administrators. Tax systems change at a glacial pace, while the half life of many technologies can sometimes be counted in months. Reconciling these two factors requires foresight and an awareness of how technology is changing.</p>

<p>There is an interesting article in <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-05-08-cellphone-taxes_x.htm">USA Today</a> that highlights some recent actions taken by state governments enhance their revenue collections from telecommunications taxes. There is also an <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=6191&amp;sequence=0">interesting report</a> on the Congressional Budget Office site regarding <acronym title="Universal Service Fund">USF</acronym> taxes.</p>

<p>It would be nice to be able to point to a report or analysis on this issue conducted by organizations like the <a href="http://www.taxadmin.org/">Federation of State Tax Administrators</a>, or the <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/">National Association of State Legislatures</a>, or even the <a href="http://www.nga.org/center/1,1188,,00.html">National Governorâ€™s Association</a>. Sadly, I couldnâ€™t find anything relevant through a search of their sites. Not a good sign.</p>
