      <h1> Voxeo Announces New Tropo Hotness: COBOL!</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>Several weeks ago, Voxeo rocked the voice application development world by introducing <a href="http://www.tropo.com/" target="_blank">Tropo</a>, a new platform that allows developers to build voice applications in a <a href="http://docs.tropo.com/" target="_blank">variety of different languages</a>.</p>

<p>Tropo lets developers build voice applications in JavaScript, Ruby, Python, PHP and more. I mentioned Tropo briefly in <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=759">my last post</a>, where I describe a voice application I built using VoiceXML/PHP — I’ll be porting this app to Tropo shortly so that it will be close to 100% PHP and running on the Tropo platform.</p>

<p>Voxeo announced today that they are adding support for yet another development language to Tropo — <strong>COBOL</strong>. This is big – it brings the total number of languages supported to a half dozen. I can’t wait to see what Voxeo has in store for Tropo next!</p>

<p>Let me tell you something – you go into a bar and drop some hints that you are coding your Tropo app in COBOL and you will not be leaving alone.</p>

<p>I guarantee it!</p>
