      <h1> A Look at Google&#8217;s FCC Auction Strategy</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>The NY Times has a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/04/technology/04auction.html?_r=1&amp;ref=technology&amp;oref=slogin">really interesting article</a> detailing the strategy of Google executives bidding on wireless spectrum in the recent FCC auction.</p>

<p>Google’s legacy from this historic auction is that it helped ensure that a portion of the spectrum purchased would be <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/07/23/2020216&amp;from=rss">subject to specific requirements of openness</a>. The “C Block” of spectrum that the FCC will require be managed under the tenants of openness was ultimately <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,143675-pg,1/article.html">won by Verizon Wireless</a>.</p>

<p>Even though Google didn’t “win” the auction for the C Block outright, there are those that believe that their strategy of opening up the world of wireless communication may have been served nonetheless:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œIf Google had won a license, there was only downside risk for them,â€ said Gregory L. Rosston, a former F.C.C. official and senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. â€œNow they can just spend $1 million a year on a law firm to ensure Verizon lives up to the openness requirements.â€</p>
