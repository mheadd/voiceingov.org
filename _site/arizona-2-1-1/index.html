      <h1> Arizona 2-1-1</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>A while back, I wrote an entry about <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=51">Abbreviated Dialing Codes</a> used by governments (sometimes referred to as N11).</p>

<p>The State of Arizona has <a href="http://www.govtech.net/news/news.php?id=100058">announced the results</a> of the first year of activity for its 2-1-1 service, which includes both an online component and a call center.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Arizonaâ€™s Strategic Plan for 2-1-1 calls for the phased implementation of 2-1-1. The next step for the program is development of local 2-1-1 call centers serving all Arizonans day-to-day as well as in times of emergency.</p>
