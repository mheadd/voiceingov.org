  <p><strong>What is VoiceXML?</strong></p>

<p>In simplest terms, VoiceXML is a web technology that turns any telephone, even a rotary phone, into an Internet device.</p>

<p>VoiceXML is a non-proprietary, web-based markup language for creating vocal dialogues between humans and computers. VoiceXML is similar to another common markup language — <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym>, the basic language of visual web pages.</p>

<p>Just as a web browser renders HTML documents visually, a VoiceXML interpreter renders VoiceXML documents audibly. In this respect, one can think of the VoiceXML interpreter as a telephone-based, voice browser. As with HTML documents, VoiceXML documents have web <acronym title="Uniform Resource Identifiers">URIs</acronym> and can be located on any web server. However, instead of pointing a client-side web browser at a specific URI, citizens can access a VoiceXML application by calling a toll free telephone number from any ordinary telephone – cellular or traditional, touch-tone or rotary.</p>

<p><strong>The Future of VoiceXML and the Voice Web:</strong></p>

<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has issued VoiceXML 2.0 as</p>

<p>a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/03/voicexml2-pressrelease">W3C Recommendation</a>. VoiceXML is part of a collection of interrelated languages being developed by the W3C’s Voice Browser Working Group. These languages, referred to collectively as the “<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-voice-intro-20001204/">Speech Interface Framework</a>” will be used for developing speech applications on the Internet and represent the future of the Voice Web.</p>
