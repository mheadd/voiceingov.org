      <h1> My Favorite Linux Commands: find</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>Over the next week or so (as time allows), I’ll attempt to write a short summary of my favorite Linux commands. These are commands that I use regularly and make my life a lot easier. Hopefully, they’ll make your life easier too. Up first, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">find</code> command.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, you can use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">find</code> command to locate files (and other things ;-)). What is surprising is the large number of options that you can set to find exactly the file(s) that you are looking for, and take action on them.</p>

<p>Let’s say that I have a directory called “sale” with JPEG files in it that have differences in their file extension (i.e, some were saved as *.jpg, and some as *.JPG) and their permission settings. I’d like to know how many of each I have, and then I’d like to change the permissions on a subset of them, to make those that are currently not readable by the “other” group readable.</p>

<p>First, lets see how many files are in the directory:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">$ find sale/ -type f -iname "*.jpg"&lt;br /&gt;
sale/P9130285.JPG&lt;br /&gt;
sale/P9130286.JPG&lt;br /&gt;
sale/P9130287.JPG&lt;br /&gt;
sale/P9130288.JPG&lt;br /&gt;
sale/P9130289.JPG&lt;br /&gt;
sale/P9130290.JPG&lt;br /&gt;
sale/P9130291.JPG&lt;br /&gt;
sale/phone_1.jpg&lt;br /&gt;
sale/phone_2.jpg&lt;br /&gt;
sale/phone_3.jpg&lt;br /&gt;
sale/phone_4.jpg&lt;br /&gt;
sale/phone_5.jpg</code></p>

<p>Like other Linux commands, you can direct the output of <code class="highlighter-rouge">find</code> into another command to get a summary count of all the files located:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">$ find sale/ -type f -iname "*.jpg" | wc -l&lt;br /&gt;
12</code></p>

<p>In the above example, I use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-type</code> option and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-iname</code> option to list all files with a .jpg extension (regardless of case). Not surprisingly, using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-name</code> option applies a similar, but case sensitive, pattern match on file names:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">$ find sale/* -type f -name "*.jpg"&lt;br /&gt;
sale/phone_1.jpg&lt;br /&gt;
sale/phone_2.jpg&lt;br /&gt;
sale/phone_3.jpg&lt;br /&gt;
sale/phone_4.jpg&lt;br /&gt;
sale/phone_5.jpg</code></p>

<p>There are a large number of options that can be used, and the real power of this command comes from a thorough understanding of them. One of the most useful, in my opinion, is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-exec</code> option. This option lets you do something specific with each file that is found. To change the permissions on all files with a case sensitive “.jpg” extension and make the files readable by the “other” group, you could use the following:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">find sale/* -type f -name "*.jpg" -exec chmod o+r {} ;</code></p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">-exec</code> option lets you specify another command that is run on each file found (represented by the {} argument). Note, you also need to end the command issued by <code class="highlighter-rouge">-exec</code> with an escaped semicolon. Using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">find</code> command in this way can be enormously helpful for doing things like clearing out old log files. I typically use <code class="highlighter-rouge">find</code> in a cron job that searches directories for log files older than a certain amount of time (using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-mtime</code> option) and then deletes them from the directory:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">find logs/ -type f -name "*log*" -mtime +30 -exec rm {} ;</code></p>

<p>If you’re like me you will probably have an arsenal of commands that you use on a regular basis, to quickly and easily do the things that you do almost every day. Having the <code class="highlighter-rouge">find</code> command in your arsenal can make life a lot easier.</p>
