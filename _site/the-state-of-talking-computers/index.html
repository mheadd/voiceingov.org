      <h1> The State of Talking Computers</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>The New Yorker has <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/06/23/080623fa_fact_seabrook">an interesting piece</a> about the state of speech synthesis and voice recognition. Decades after the original notion of the “conversational computer” was first conceptualized, where are we?</p>

<p>Turns out, we’re not as far along as we thought we’d be. Scientists and researchers found out the hard way that modeling speech is waaaaaay harder than anyone thought it would be. Don’t go throwing that keyboard away just yet.</p>

<p>A fascinating read — we’ve come so far, and yet we are still so far away from the original vision of the talking computer.</p>
