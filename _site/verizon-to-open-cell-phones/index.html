      <h1> Verizon to Open Cell Phones?</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/28/technology/28phone.html?_r=1&amp;ref=technology&amp;oref=slogin">This</a> is big. To understand the root cause of this, one need only look to Mountain View, California (the headquarters of Google).</p>

<p>It was Google that pressed the FCC to <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/20070720_wireless.html">open up</a> the auction on the 700 Mhz spectrum. And it was Google that got the ball rolling on the <a href="http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/">Open Handset Alliance</a>.</p>

<p>There is an interesting lesson that can be taken away from this:</p>

<p>Openness + Choice == Innovation!</p>

<p>Or, to quote Lowell McAdam, chief executive of Verizon Wireless:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œThe trend we see here is an explosion of innovation. People want to take so much of whatâ€™s on the Internet and put it on the phone.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lots of other places in the software world that could benefit from applying this philosophy.</p>
