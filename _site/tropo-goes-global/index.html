      <h1> Tropo Goes Global</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>A couple of months back, <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=1314">I wrote a post</a> about how nontraditional communication channels – IM, SMS, social networks, etc. – are changing the way that businesses and governments interact with their customers. These channels are “nontraditional” because they are not typically utilized to provide customer service, or to take orders.</p>

<p>That is changing, and the <a href="http://blog.tropo.com/2010/03/25/tropo-adds-twitter-and-goes-international/" target="_blank">announcement today from Voxeo</a> about their new Tropo service is both evidence of that change, and the catalyst for even more change.</p>

<p>I’ve always been impressed with <a href="https://www.tropo.com/home.jsp" target="_blank">Tropo</a>, and not long ago I worked on <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?cat=58">a series of posts</a> demonstrating how to utilize the Tropo platform with the utterly awesome NoSQL database <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/" target="_blank">CouchDB</a>.</p>

<p>The newly reworked Tropo adds an impressive array of new features. It’s not all that unusual any more to see cloud telephony services offering SMS support – it makes sense, and its right in line with what I have been saying about how nontraditional communications channels are becoming more important. Tropo goes <a href="https://www.tropo.com/how-it-works/home.jsp" target="_blank">way beyond this</a> by adding support for an array of IM networks and also for Twitter (the 800 lb gorilla of nontraditional communication channels).</p>

<p>The international support for Tropo is also impressive – they provide international numbers for inbound calls, and can also handle outbound dialing to international numbers. Phone applications can use international <acronym title="Text-to-Speech">TTS</acronym> engines to render content to non-English users. Even more impressive, Tropo’s speech recognition capabilities (which have always separated it from other cloud telephony providers) can now support a number of foreign languages – UK English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Mexican Spanish or Castilian Spanish.</p>

<p>Tropo is an impressive platform for a number of reasons. It used to be very hard (and, in some respects, still is) to build a great phone application. The Tropo platform allows developers to build great phone applications, and to leverage the investment in these apps by extending them to other channels and other countries.</p>

<p>A single code base serving different customers on multiple channels. That’s powerful.</p>

<p>And now, with the release of the new Tropo service, a single code base can serve multiple channels in multiple countries in multiple languages.</p>

<p>The times they are indeed a-changin’.</p>
