      <h1> The State of the X+V Standard</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>A very interesting new extension for the Firefox web browser became available recently on alphaWorks (IBM’s site devoted to emerging technologies). The <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/tadpole">“Tadpole” extension</a> implements the <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?page_id=13">X+V specification</a> for the Firefox web browser.</p>

<p>Those already familiar with X+V know that the Opera browser has, for some time, <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/voice/">supported this language</a> for building multimodal applications. However, a Firefox extension for X+V raises some additional possibilities — a mashup between X+V and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xul/" title="XML User Interface Language">XUL</a> anyone?</p>

<p>While I lack the courage to build the necessary <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/tadpole/requirements">software prerequisites</a> to run this extension (like the Opera browser’s support for X+V, the Tadpole extension will only work on Windows) reading about it did inspire me to upgrade to the latest version of the Opera browser — 9.24 — and play around with some X+V samples.</p>

<p>It got me thinking about the X+V standard and where it’s heading. It’s very likely that the W3C’s work on the new VoiceXML 3.0 standard will incorporate changes meant to support multimodal applications. A sneak preview of the new standard can be viewed <a href="http://www.w3.org/Voice/2006/voicexml3.pdf">on the W3C site</a>.</p>

<p>To say that I’m excited for the first public draft of the VoiceXML 3.0 standard next Spring would be a monumental understatement!</p>
