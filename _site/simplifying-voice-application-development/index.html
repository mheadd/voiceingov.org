      <h1> Simplifying Voice Application Development</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>Last September, IBM made a notable contribution to the voice development community by <a href="http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/09/20/1646226&amp;tid=89">providing the Apache foundation</a> with a set of reusable dialog components for creating voice and multimodal applications. While some at the time criticized the contribution as “discardware,” the folks at Apache recently announced that <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/news/news-2005-q3.html#20050726.1">version 1.0 of the Reusable Dialog Component Taglib</a> is now available for use by developers.</p>

<p>How useful these components are for aiding the rapid development of voice applications remains to be seen – a lot is riding on how developers react to this news.</p>

<p>There are other efforts out there to make developing voice applications generally, and VoiceXML applications specifically, more efficient. There is a set of PHP libraries <a href="http://vxml.sourceforge.net/">available on SourceForge</a> for creating VoiceXML/CCXML/SRGS applications. My own meager contribution to this broader effort is a <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?page_id=16">small PHP class library</a> that can be used to generate SRGS grammars in XML format.</p>

<p>Hopefully, we are only seeing the beginning of a broader and more sustained effort to simplify voice application development.</p>
