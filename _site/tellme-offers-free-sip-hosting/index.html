      <h1> TellMe Offers Free SIP Hosting</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>TellMe is now offering an <a href="https://studio.tellme.com/freesip/reachingaudience.html">interesting new hosting option for VoiceXML applications</a>. Developers that use the TellMe studio can sign up for a limited access hosting account that will allow up to four simultaneous calls to reach their application. All calls must utilize SIP to reach the VoiceXML application.</p>

<p>I have yet to dig into the details, but this sounds very interesting. Iâ€™ve used the TellMe studio in the past, and it has some great features. In fact, the first VoiceXML applications deployed by <a href="http://dti.delaware.gov/services/accessde.shtml">State of Delaware</a> when I worked there used the TellMe platform (not sure if they still do).</p>

<p>For those that have not tried the TellMe studio, this might be a great incentive to give it a whirl. As IP telephony becomes more ubiquitous, it will be interesting to see how the major VoiceXML platforms shake up their service offerings.</p>
