      <h1> Some more 2-1-1 news</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p><a href="http://www.211maine.org/" target="_blank">Maine</a> has joined 15 other states in rolling out a 2-1-1 service. <a href="http://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/index.php?topic=Portal+News&amp;id=22123&amp;v=article-2006" target="_blank">Governor John Baldacci</a> was on hand last week to place the inaugural call.</p>

<p>Interestingly, there doesnâ€™t appear to be any automation with the Maine 2-1-1 service. All calls (24/7) go to a representative.</p>

<p>Where is the fun in thatâ€¦? ðŸ˜‰</p>
