      <h1> New VoiceObjects Developer Edition Available</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>Just got an email informing me of a new devloper release of <a href="http://www.voiceobjects.com/en/products/index.html" target="_blank">VoiceObjects</a> (version 7.4).Â  This bit caught my attention:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Support for 2-way SMS dialogs</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>VoiceObjects 7.4 has expanded the text channel so that in addition to USSD dialogs, text messaging from mobile devices using the Short Message Service (SMS) is now supported…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow! If you’re a developer and that doesn’t get your juices flowing then you may want to get yourself checked out.</p>

<p>I’m going to download the new version today and start playing around with 2-way SMS messaging.</p>
