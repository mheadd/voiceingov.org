  <p>I’ve posted a <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?page_id=33">new tutorial</a> showing my take on the “Confidence-Based Confirmation” technique first outlined by <a href="http://www.voicexmlreview.org/feb2005/columns/Feb2005_speak_listen.html">Matt Oshry</a> of TellMe networks. This example uses a VoiceXML subdialog approach to confirm caller utterances, and also leverages the new functionality provided by the VoiceXML 2.1 specification to record caller input while performing a recognition. This approach is critical to the use of <a href="http://vote.nist.gov/ecposstatements/phone_voting_whitepaper.doc">VoiceXML in telephone-based voting systems</a>. A complete overview and sample code are provided.</p>
