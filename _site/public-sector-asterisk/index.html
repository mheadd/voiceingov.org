      <h1> Public Sector Asterisk</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>Recently came across some information from a small city in Mississippi that is using Asterisk/Trixbox for it’s <a href="http://web.vicksburg.org/vicksburg/Departments/IT/PhoneSystem/tabid/260/Default.aspx" target="_blank">internal phone system</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vicksburg.org/" target="_blank">Vicksburg</a> is a city of about 26,000 in Western Mississippi that looks to have a roughly 200 extension Asterisk system in place for city employees.</p>

<p>It’s nice to see governments making use of open source technologies, particularly Asterisk — it <strong>isn’t</strong> just for small businesses. I wonder how many other small to medium sized governments are using a flavor of Asterisk for their phone systems?</p>
