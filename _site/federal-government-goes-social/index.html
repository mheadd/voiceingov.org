      <h1> Federal Government Goes Social</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>A couple of pretty significant social networking developments this week relating to the federal government.</p>

<p>First, YouTube joined with members of Congress this week to launch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/senatehub" target="_blank">SenateHub</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/househub" target="_blank">HouseHub</a> which aggregate YouTube channels for members of Congress. Unfortunately, neither of my Senators (one of whom is about to become VP) has a YouTube channel. Booo!</p>

<p>Also, the outgoing Adminstrator of FEMA, David Paulson, held a <a href="http://www.fema.gov/media/2009/010909.shtm" target="_blank">Twitter “media conference”</a> on Monday in which members of the public were allowed to submit questions and get answers via Twitter. This is a neat idea, and a very novel use of Twitter. I wish others would follow Administrator Paulson’s lead.</p>

<p>All this, and its only Tuesday…</p>
