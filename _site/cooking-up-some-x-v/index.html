      <h1> Cooking up Some X + V</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>I’ve got a <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?page_id=53">new tutorial</a> up explaining how to turn XHTML into X+V using a nice little PHP class library called <a href="http://minixml.psychogenic.com/">MiniXML</a>. This approach is still a bit rough, and I’m continuing to refine it but it seems to work fairly well for small to moderately sized XHTML documents.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think this could become a very powerful and flexible way to turn plain old visual XHTML into multimodal X+V with nothing more than Apache/PHP and some clever coding. <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?page_id=53">Have a look</a> and let me know what you think.</p>
