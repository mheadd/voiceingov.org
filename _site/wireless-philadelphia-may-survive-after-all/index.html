      <h1> Wireless Philadelphia May Survive After All</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>It looks like a <a href="http://www.philly.com/dailynews/local/20080617_Wireless_Philadelphia_may_survive_after_all.html">group of local investors</a> may pick up where EarthLink left off.</p>

<p>This is good news, but more work is still needed to complete the network:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We’re not anywhere near close to delivering a full service yet,” said local entrepreneur Richard A. Rasansky, who is on the board of the new company [that will take over the network]. “The network is not completed. It’s not so much a problem with how it’s built, it’s that it’s currently unbuilt.”</p>
