      <h1> IP Telephony &#038; Voice 2.0?</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>Meg Whitman, Chair and CEO of eBay, made <a href="http://news.com.com/eBay+chief+foresees+free+voice+calls+for+all/2100-7352_3-5904540.html">an interesting prediction</a> about the futrure of Internet telephony recently. In an interview with financial analysts discussing eBay’s purchase of Skype, Whitman said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In the end, the price that anyone can provide for voice transmission on the ‘Net will trend toward zero…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This raises questions about what is next for the world of telephony and voice applications. There is an <a href="http://iotum.com/simplyrelevant/2005/10/21/voice-20-a-manifesto-for-the-future/">interesting post</a> on the Simply Relevant blog describing the concept of â€œVoice 2.0.â€ The concept and term (which appears to be derived from the notion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a>) are, in the words of the author:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œâ€¦the marriage of IP Telephony to the Web.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a good discussion in this post about the confluence of certain factors that will drive the development of Voice 2.0 â€“ things like meterless calling (via Skype or a similar service), development tools for building web applications like <a href="http://vxml.sourceforge.net/">PHPVoice</a> (a project to which I am a contributor) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presence_Information">presence</a>.</p>

<p>While I agree with the author, Iâ€™d add another recent technology to the mix â€“ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting">podcasting</a>. One of the key differences between the visual web and the voice web (or Voice 2.0 if you want to think of it that way) is permanence. A voice conversation or interaction happens in real time while the visual web has more permanence â€“ value can be â€œstored upâ€ as text or images and reread, reviewed and referenced for an indefinite period of time.</p>

<p>Podcasting is a recent trend that seeks to do something similar with voice â€“ to store the value of a conversation in the form of an MP3 file that can be referenced at a later time. Its still pretty new, but so is this whole concept of Voice 2.0 (or Web 2.0 for that matter).</p>
