      <h1> Why I Like Gizmo</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>Oprah <a href="http://www.mediaincanada.com/articles/mic/20080305/oprah.html">loves Skype</a>, but I’m pretty fond of <a href="http://gizmo5.com/pc/products/desktop/">Gizmo</a>.</p>

<p>If your like me then you’ve probably got a number of different VoIP and IM clients running on your computer(s) — Skype, Google Talk, Gizmo, etc. I’ve used Skype heavily in the past, but I’ve now moved on to Gizmo. Here’s why:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>I want something that will run on Linux</strong>. No, I don’t use Windows unless I have to, so this pretty much takes Google Talk out of the picture.</li>
  <li><strong>I want something that will let me IM contacts in multiple networks</strong>. Google Talk can do this, as can Gizmo — Skype can’t.</li>
  <li><strong>I want something that will hook into my Asterisk server easily</strong>. Google Talk <a href="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Asterisk+Speaks+with+Google+Talk">can do this</a>, but it’s a <a href="http://gizmo5.com/pc/network/asterix-support/">piece of cake with Gizmo</a> because it uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol">SIP</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, Gizmo works great with services like <a href="http://www.grandcentral.com/howitworks/gizmo">GrandCentral</a>. To be fair, Google Talk has everything I want — if it only ran on Linux I’d be on it like stink on a monkey. Perhaps in time.</p>

<p>Skype may be more popular, and Goggle Talk may have more buzz but Gizmo is the VoIP / IM client for me. For now…</p>
