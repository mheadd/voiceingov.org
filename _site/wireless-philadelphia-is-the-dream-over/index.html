  <p><a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/cityhall/BREAKING_NEWS_EarthLink_To_Dump_Wireless_Philadelphia_Next_Month.html">Disappointing news</a> from the Wireless Philadelphia project â€“ it seems EarthLink is throwing in the towel. The <a href="http://www.wirelessphiladelphia.org/blog_detail.cfm/blog/68">latest statement</a> from the Wireless Philadelphia CEO is more encouraging:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wireless Philadelphia is utterly steadfast in its determination to extend internet access to all members of the community, and we intend to do everything in our power to continue the momentum generated by WP in support of Digital Inclusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope that the goals of this project can still be achieved, but it ain’t looking good right now. 🙁</p>
