      <h1> AJAX in VoiceXML Applications</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>With all of the buzz of late around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">AJAX</a> (an acronym first coined by <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">Jesse James Garrett</a> to stand for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), it was only a matter of time before the discussion began about using this approach in VoiceXML applications. There is an <a href="http://www.voicexmlreview.org/columns/Jun2005_speak_listen.html">interesting article</a> in the new VoiceXML review covering this topic.</p>

<p>The approach described in this article makes use of the new <data> element that is part of the VoiceXML 2.1 specification. Iâ€™m not clear on whether this approach is the same as AJAX, but it is indeed powerful.</data></p>

<p>AJAX applications rely on a JavaScript object called â€œ<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/02/09/xml-http-request.html">XMLHttpRequest</a>â€ that allows a web interface to communicate with a backend server without transitioning to new page. More traditional web applications submit user input to, or request data from, a backend server using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/whenToUseGet.html">HTTP GET and POST methods</a>. The transmission of this data and the subsequent transition to a new page can sometimes be perceived as disjointed and inelegant by users. AJAX allows web interfaces to fetch or submit data without transitioning to a new page, making them feel smoother (I guess).</p>

<p>The VoiceXML 2.1 [<data> element](http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/CR-voicexml21-20050613/#sec-data) doesnâ€™t work exactly like this. It allows a developer to designate an XML document to be fetched by a VoiceXML interpreter as part of a dialog. It then exposes that document via the [JavaScript binding to the Document Object Model](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/ecma-script-binding.html). Its â€œAJAX-likeâ€ in the sense that it obviates the need for a page transition to render the data in the XML document, but there isnâ€™t any asynchronous communication with a backend server through an XMLHttpRequest object.</data></p>

<p>Given the recent hype, I can understand the desire to characterize the functionality provided by the new 2.1 spec as emulating AJAX. But I think itâ€™s important to point out that callers to a VoiceXML application probably donâ€™t perceive page transitions in the same way that users of a visual web application do. There are <a href="http://cafe.bevocal.com/docs/vxml/fetching.html">ways to manage user reactions</a> to these transitions within VoiceXML and users need to be aware of how to use them effectively.</p>
