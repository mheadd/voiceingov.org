  <p>It appears that the FEMA web site — where victims of Hurricane Katrina can submit requests for relief assistance — is <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/buzz/archive/2005_09.html#a000563">not compatible with certain browsers</a>, and may hinder some from filing requests.</p>

<p>This is an object lesson in the need to create accessible, standards-compliant web applications. Surely we can do better than this. Maybe FEMA Director Michael Brown can <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9315184/">focus on this</a> when he retuirns to Washington.</p>
