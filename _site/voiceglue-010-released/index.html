      <h1> VoiceGlue 0.10 Released</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>For those that don’t know, <a href="http://www.voiceglue.org/" target="_blank">Voiceglue</a> is an open source project that links <a href="http://www.asterisk.org/" target="_blank">Asterisk</a> (the open source PBX) with <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/openvxi/index.html" target="_blank">OpenVXI</a> (an open source VoiceXML platform currently under the stewardship of Vocalocity). Voiceglue makes it possible for Asterisk users to deploy a completely open source VoiceXML platform for building IVRs and other useful applications.</p>

<p>The Voiceglue project recently announced the release of version 0.10 – there are several new features in this release:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improved audio caching</li>
  <li>Cookie passing on audio fetching</li>
  <li>Handles maxage and audiomaxage of 0 properly</li>
  <li>Uses HTTP Content-Type for audio content when available</li>
  <li>Defaults to not requiring access-control directive in returned data from data tag</li>
  <li>New transfer method, new config file param “blind_xfer_method”</li>
  <li>Auto-install support for Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty)</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m especially interested in the last item – I’ve been meaning to set up a VM to play around with Ubuntu 9.04 for a few weeks now, and this is yet another good reason for doing so.</p>

<p>The new version of Voiceglue can be <a href="http://www.voiceglue.org/download/" target="_blank">downloaded here</a>.</p>
