      <h1> On the demise of SALT</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>There has been much talk of late on Microsoft’s announcement that it will <a href="http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;868712853;fp;2;fpid;1">support VoiceXML</a> in a forthcoming version of Speech Server. Many that I have read or listened to have pointed to this as</p>

<p>There is ample evidence that Microsoft has no problem advancing it’s own standard – even under the banner of â€œopennessâ€ – if it sees a financial benefit in doing so. If you don’t agree, I’d refer you to the debate raging about an <a href="http://news.com.com/Massachusetts+moves+ahead+sans+Microsoft/2100-1012_3-5878869.html">open document format</a>. So, while I agree wholeheartedly with the second point, I’m not so sure I agree with the first. At least not totally.</p>

<p>I think the bad news in Microsoft’s announcement can be identified by remembering what it’s nascent SALT specification was designed to do. <a href="http://www.saltforum.org/faq/faq.asp">Speech Application Language Tags</a> were designed to be extensions to XHTML â€“ in other words, the specification was developed specifically to build multimodal applications. And although you can build pure telephone applications with SALT, this was not the original intent.</p>

<p>So, if Microsoft suddenly got religion and decided to support VoiceXML for building telephone applications it may mean that multimodal applications aren’t going anywhere for a while. That’s bad news in my opinion.</p>

<p>I’d ask that readers refute this assertion by pointing out some existing production uses of multimodal technology. If they can find any…</p>
