      <h1> What Matters in Cloud Telephony</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>The landscape of cloud telephony continues to change.</p>

<p>I was heartened this week to see some of the sharpest minds I know in cloud telephony and unified communications get together with the acquisition of <a href="http://teleku.com">Teleku</a> by <a href="http://www.voxeo.com">Voxeo</a>. Teleku and Voxeoâ€™s <a href="http://tropo.com">Tropo</a> service are complimentary ones that offer lots of goodies for developers, and Iâ€™m anxious to see what these guys will be cooking up now that they have joined forces. Congrats to all involved!</p>

<p>While there is lots of discussion about <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/08/11/voxeo-tropo-teleku/">what this acquisition means for the constantly changing landscape of cloud telephony</a>, this move validates (in my mind) some of the important trends that will determine which cloud telephony companies will be around for the long-term and how developers will use their services.</p>

<p>None of this is new â€“ <a href="http://blog.cloudvox.com/post/443681724/mark-headd-on-open311-sip-portability-and-more">Iâ€™ve said it all before</a>. It is worth noting, however, that all of the trends that Iâ€™ve observed before that are going to make the difference in the cloud telephony space are ones that both Tropo and Teleku do very well.</p>

<p><strong>Portability</strong> â€“ underscored not only by Telekuâ€™s support for the open standard VoiceXML, but also the Tropo crewâ€™s involvement in the Asterisk world, and the defacto standard for building Asterisk apps in Ruby â€“ <a href="http://adhearsion.com/">Adhearsion</a>.</p>

<p><strong>SIP integration</strong> â€“ remember this kids: true cloud telephony has <a href="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/SIP">SIP</a> baked in â€“ the rest is just marketing fluff. Both Tropo and Teleku support SIP interoperability and make it very easy for developers to use SIP as part of their applications.</p>

<p><strong>Multi-channel / multi-modality</strong> â€“ Both Tropo and Teleku have big multi-modal chops. Being able to interact with users on multiple communication channels from one code base is a key tenet of unified communications and cloud telephony, and this will become increasingly important in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Speech recognition</strong> â€“ cloud telephony isnâ€™t your grandfatherâ€™s way to build a phone app, so why should users be restricted to their grandfatherâ€™s way of interacting with a phone app? Speech recognition is fully supported in both Tropo and Teleku, and this will matter more and more to cloud telephony developers going forward.</p>

<p>So if youâ€™re wondering what the next change in the cloud telephony landscape will be, you can bet that one of these trends will dictate the change.</p>

<p>Until then, Iâ€™ll be hacking on some cloud-based, speech rec enabled UC apps. ðŸ˜‰</p>
