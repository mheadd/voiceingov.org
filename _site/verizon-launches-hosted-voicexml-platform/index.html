  <p>A friend just sent <a href="http://www.speechtechmag.com/Articles/News/News-Feature/Verizon-Launches-Hosted-Speech-Platform-49901.aspx" target="_blank">this</a> to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Verizon Business today launched Open Hosted Speech Services (OHSS), a speech platform that allows customers to create and host their own speech applications…[the platform includes] a hosted IVR application, a VoiceXML interpreter, text-to-speech capabilities, and a speaker verification application.</p>

<p>Hey, Verizon… 2001 called for you. Its wants its idea back.</p>

<p>Companies like <a href="http://www.voxeo.com/">Voxeo</a>, <a href="http://bevocal.com/corporateweb/">BeVocal</a> (now owned by Nuance) and <a href="https://studio.tellme.com/">TellMe</a> (now owned by Microsoft) have been doing this for a long time.</p>
