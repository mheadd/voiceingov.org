      <h1> Good stuff from the W3C</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>The World Wide Web Consortium has been busy recently advancing standards that make up the Speech Interface Framework:</p>

<ul>
  <li>VoiceXML 2.1 is now a <a href="http://www.w3.org/News/2007#item78">Proposed Recommendation</a>. No surprise here, as most platforms have already adopted the changes in the 2.1 spec.</li>
  <li>Semantic Interpretation is a W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/News/2007#item65">Recommendation</a>. This is an important one that <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=82">I have written on before</a>. There is a clear need for some standardization among ASR vendors with respect to SI.</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be nice to see some more movement on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-ccxml-20070119/">CCXML specification</a>. Hopefully soonâ€¦</p>
