      <h1> Who&#8217;s using phone voting?</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>Voting is one of the most fundamental activities of a representative democracy, yet the issue of Internet voting continues to be <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,62109,00.html">a contentious one</a> for governments in the USA and Europe. The issue of phone-based voting is <a href="http://vote.org/televote.htm">not new</a> , although its consideration by and large predates the development of VoiceXML. Most current discussions of phone-based voting involve the use of cell phones with WAP technologies or text messaging.</p>

<p>Telephone voting is currently used in England (as is voting by text message). Some interesting information on the use of phone voting in England can be found <a href="http://www.govtech.net/magazine/story.php?id=29354">here</a>. I have read in some places that Oregon is testing telephone voting for absentee voters, but I’ve found no hard information on this.</p>

<p>An argument could be made that phone-based voting – using VoiceXML and related technologies – could go a long way towards addressing the issues raised in the current Internet voting debate.</p>
