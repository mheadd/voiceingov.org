      <h1> The Penguin Loves Obama</h1>
<div id="content">  
  <p>Will he love the penguin back?</p>

<p>That’s the hope of a number of prominent open source advocates who have written <a href="http://consideropensource.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">an open letter</a> to President Obama encouraging greater use of open source software in the federal government:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/penguin.jpg" alt="penguin" title="Linux baby..." style="float:right;padding-left:20px;padding-right:15px;margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:15px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. President, we believe the open-source industry is changing the world of software development in many of the ways you have promised to change American politics. The values of open source mirror those you promoted in your campaign: hope, change, and openness. We, the undersigned, sincerely hope that you will make the use of open-source software a key component of every new technology initiative the United States government enters into during your presidency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s hoping that President Obama sees the connection between his campaign’s call for change and embracing better ideas for our future, and the principles of open source software development.</p>
