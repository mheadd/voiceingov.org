**What is VoiceXML?**

In simplest terms, VoiceXML is a web technology that turns any telephone, even a rotary phone, into an Internet device.

VoiceXML is a non-proprietary, web-based markup language for creating vocal dialogues between humans and computers. VoiceXML is similar to another common markup language &#8212; <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym>, the basic language of visual web pages.

Just as a web browser renders HTML documents visually, a VoiceXML interpreter renders VoiceXML documents audibly. In this respect, one can think of the VoiceXML interpreter as a telephone-based, voice browser. As with HTML documents, VoiceXML documents have web <acronym title="Uniform Resource Identifiers">URIs</acronym> and can be located on any web server. However, instead of pointing a client-side web browser at a specific URI, citizens can access a VoiceXML application by calling a toll free telephone number from any ordinary telephone &#8211; cellular or traditional, touch-tone or rotary.

**The Future of VoiceXML and the Voice Web:**

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has issued VoiceXML 2.0 as
  
a [W3C Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/2004/03/voicexml2-pressrelease). VoiceXML is part of a collection of interrelated languages being developed by the W3C&#8217;s Voice Browser Working Group. These languages, referred to collectively as the &#8220;[Speech Interface Framework](http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-voice-intro-20001204/)&#8221; will be used for developing speech applications on the Internet and represent the future of the Voice Web.
